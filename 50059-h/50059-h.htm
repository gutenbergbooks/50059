<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Etiquette</span> has been tersely defined as “the art
of doing the proper thing in the proper way.” An
acquaintance with the rules of etiquette is of the
greatest service to all who are brought into contact
with Society, and in these days few, if any, are
wholly outside of the world of social usage and
convention.</p>

<p>In this little Manual, it is not intended to lay
down, in the fullest sense, rules for the guidance
of the reader in all stations of social life, but rather
to furnish hints that may prove useful in dealing
with those social events that are of most frequent
occurrence. The etiquette of the parlor, the assembly
chamber, the street, the social function, is
something all should know, since to be ignorant
concerning such matters is to class one’s self as uninformed
on many things that go to make up the
sum total of everyday life, and to know and practice
which adds greatly to the pleasure of living.
The well-bred man or woman is always welcomed,
whereas the person who has no acquaintance with
even the most ordinary social rules is quite differently
regarded by the majority of people.</p>

<p>Nor is there any reason why an acquaintance
with social usages should longer be confined, as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the past, to certain classes. The farmer’s boy, the
intelligent mechanic and the humblest clerk or
artisan, in these days of widely-diffused knowledge,
may familiarize themselves with the customs and
observances of polite society to an extent that
will go far toward placing them on a level with
those who would otherwise be regarded as their
superiors. Refined manners are the boundary line
between the ignorant and the cultured, and it is
within the power of all to aspire to belong to that
class of men and women whose presence is always
agreeable, and who combine, in rare degree, that
charm of manners and morals which is always
allied with true nobility of character.</p>

<h2>HOW TO BEHAVE.</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Introductions.</span></h3>

<p>Ladies who are on a social equality are introduced
to each other, and so also are gentlemen.
The latter, however, are always presented to ladies.</p>

<p>When the difference between the parties is a
debatable one, it is the formal custom among many
to say, “Mrs. A., this is Mrs. H.; Mrs. H., Mrs. A.”</p>

<p>Where a gentleman is presented to a lady by another
gentleman, permission must first be secured
from the lady, and afterward the presentation is
made complimentary by this formula: “Mr.
Mortimer desires to be presented to Mrs. or Miss
Fairfax.” Or if the individual making the presentation
desires the unknown parties to become
acquainted for his or her own personal reasons,
this form can be used: “This is Mr. Mortimer,
Mrs. Fairfax. It gives me pleasure to present him
to you.” The married lady, if she be glad to know
Mr. Mortimer, says so frankly and thanks the presenting
party, after which the latter retires. The
young lady expresses a polite recognition of the
gentleman presented, by bowing, smiling, and
mentioning the name of the new acquaintance as a
response. The expressed gratification must come
from the gentleman, who will say some complimentary
thing to her in regard to the ceremony.</p>

<p>Hand shaking is not so common as it was formerly.</p>

<p>In introductions generally the younger is introduced
to the elder, except when a publicly admitted
superiority exists. The unknown is always presented
to the famous. The single lady is introduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
to the married one, and the single gentleman
to the married, other things being equal.</p>

<p>A person must conduct himself or herself, while
remaining in a house on invitation, as if there were
no more exalted society than that present.</p>

<p>To converse above the comprehension of others is
an unpardonable egotism, and to try to give the
impression that superior surroundings are the only
ones with which you are familiar is evidence to the
contrary.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bowing and Salutations.</span></h3>

<p>Bowing means recognition and nothing else, and
it is the lady’s prerogative to offer this, and the
gentleman’s to accept it. Between intimate friends
it is immaterial which bows first, the gentleman or
lady. The lady may be distant or cordial in her
salutation, and the gentleman must be responsive
to her manner, and claim no more attention than
she offers.</p>

<p>If a gentleman lifts his hat and stops after a lady
has recognized him, he may ask her permission
to turn and accompany her for a little, or even a
long distance. Under no circumstances should he
stand still in the street to converse with her, or be
offended if she excuse herself and pass on.</p>

<p>At entertainments a gentleman who is a formal
acquaintance waits for the lady-guest to recognize
his presence.</p>

<p>On entering a parlor to pay a visit, a gentleman
should always carry his hat, leaving overshoes,
overcoat, and umbrella in the hall if it be winter
time. The lady rises to receive him, unless she is
an invalid, or aged, in which case she receives him
seated. If she extends her hand to him, he takes
it, but does not remove his glove. He never offers
his hand first. If it be a brief call, and others
are present, he seldom seats himself, and takes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
leave very soon after another gentleman enters,
the lady not extending her hand a second time.
Hand-shaking is falling into disuse in ordinary
visits.</p>

<p>A lady should never accompany a gentleman to
the door of the drawing-room, much less to the
vestibule, unless she entertains a special regard for
him. She introduces him to no one, unless there
be some reason why this formality should take
place; and he talks with her other guests just as if
he had met them before. No after recognition is
warranted between gentlemen, or between ladies.
If the parties desire to be presented to each other,
the hostess should not refuse this formality if asked
to perform it.</p>

<p>There may be cases when a gentleman may lift
his hat to a lady, even though he cannot bow to
her.</p>

<p>It not infrequently happens when gentlemen are
driving, that they cannot touch their hats because
too closely occupied; but a cordial bow satisfies
under such circumstances. When riding in the
saddle he may lift his hat, or touch its rim with his
whip. Etiquette permits either style of greeting.</p>

<p>In passing a group of mourners at a door-way,
where their dead is being carried forth, or a funeral
procession in a quiet street, a gentleman should uncover
his head.</p>

<p>A gentleman should always lift his hat when tendering
a service, however slight, to a strange lady.
It may be the restoration of handkerchief or fan,
the receiving of her change, opening her umbrella
or any other courteous act. To say “Thank you!”
is not now considered necessary; it has ceased to
be etiquette.</p>

<p>A gentleman will open a door for a strange lady,
hold it open with one hand and lift his hat with the
other, while she passes through. He always quickly
offers her the precedence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>A gentleman who is walking in the street with a
lady, touches his hat, and bows to anyone she
salutes in passing. This is done in compliment to
her acquaintance, who is most likely a stranger to
him. If accompanying her across a drawing-room,
and she bows to a friend, he inclines his head also
but does not speak. He always raises his hat when
he begs a lady’s pardon for an inadvertence, whether
he is known to her or not.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Calls and Calling Cards.</span></h3>

<p>It is a rule among the best people to call upon
the stranger who is in town. If the visitor brings
letters of introduction, an <i>entree</i> to society is easy
through the usually observed forms. If strangers
who have come to reside near us, or even to visit
our locality, bear credentials of respectability,
courteous and hospitable residents will call upon
them, after sufficient time has elapsed for the recently
arrived to have adjusted themselves to their
new positions. No introduction is necessary in
such a case. The resident ladies call between two
and five o’clock, send in their own with their husbands’
or their fathers’ or brothers’ cards, and if
they find the strangers disengaged, a brief and cordial
interview ends the first visit. This must be
returned within a week, or a note of apology and
explanation for the omission is sent, and the return-visit
is then paid later on. If a card be sent in
return for this visit, or is left in person without an
effort to see the parties who have made the first
visit, it is understood that the strangers prefer solitude,
or that there are reasons why they cannot
receive visitors.</p>

<p>A gentleman should not make a first call upon
the ladies of the family of a new-comer without an
introduction or an invitation.</p>

<p>When should a lady call first on a new desirable
acquaintance? She should have met the new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
acquaintance, should have been properly introduced,
and should feel sure that her own acquaintance
is desired. The oldest resident, the one most
prominent in society, should call first. Good expedient
for a first call is the sending out of cards,
for several days in the month, by a lady who wishes
to begin her social life in a new place. These may
be accompanied by the card of some well-known
friend, or they may go out alone. If they bring
visits or cards in response, the beginner has started
on her career with no loss of self-respect. First
calls should be returned within a week.</p>

<p>After a dinner-party a guest must call in person
and inquire if the hostess is at home. For other
entertainments the lady can call by proxy, or simply
send her card. In sending to inquire for a person’s
health, cards may be sent with a courteous
message. No first visit should, however, be returned
by card only.</p>

<p>Bachelors should leave cards on the master and
mistress of the house, and the young ladies. To
turn down the corners of the card has become
almost obsolete, except, perhaps, where a lady
wishes it understood that she called in person.
The plainer the card the better. A small, thin card
for a gentleman, not glazed, with his name in small
script and his address well engraved in the corner,
is in good taste. A lady’s card should be larger,
but not glazed or ornamented.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Style of Cards.</span></h3>

<p>Ladies’ cards should be nearly square (about
2½ x 3 inches), of smooth-finished card-board, medium
weight, pearl-white in color, and the engraving
plain script.</p>

<p>A gentleman’s card is smaller and narrower,
(about 1½ × 2¾ inches), of heavier card-board, and
the engraving larger and somewhat heavier.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>If the surname is short, the full name may be
engraved. If the names are long, and the space
does not admit of their full extension, the initials
of given names may be used. The former style is
preferred, when practicable. In the absence of any
special title properly accompanying the name—as
“Rev.,” “Dr.,” “Col.,” etc.,—“Mr.” is always
prefixed. Good form requires this on an engraved
card. If in any emergency a man writes his own
name on a card he does not prefix “Mr.”</p>

<p>Omit from visiting-cards all titles that signify
transient offices, or occupations not related to social
life; using such titles only as indicate a rank or
profession that is for life; and which has become
a part of the man’s identity, or which is distinctly
allied to his social conditions. Thus: the rank of
an officer in the army or the navy should be indicated
by title on his card. His personal card is
engraved thus: “General Green”—the title in full
when only the surname is used; or, “Gen. Winfield
Green,” “Gen. W. S. Smith”—the title
abbreviated when the given names, or their initials,
are used. Officers on the retired list, and veteran
officers of the late war who rose from the volunteer
ranks, retain their titles by courtesy. The official
cards of political officers and ambassadors, with
the title and office of the man—with or without his
name—should be used only on official or State occasions,
and during the term of office.</p>

<p>Professional or business cards that bear ever so
slight an advertisement of occupations are not
allowable. The three “learned” professions, theology,
medicine, and law, are equally “for life,”
and should appear on the card. On the other hand,
the callings of the clergyman and the physician
respectively, are closely allied to the social side of
life, closely identified with the man himself. Therefore
“Rev.,” or “Dr.” may with propriety be
considered as forming an inseparable compound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
with the name. The title is an important identifying
mark, and its omission, by the clergyman, at
least, is not strictly dignified.</p>

<p>It is not good form to use merely honorary titles
on visiting-cards. In most cases, a man should lay
aside all pretension to special office or rank, and
appear in society simply as “Mr. John Brown.”
An engraved address implies some permanency of
location. Those who are liable to frequent changes
of address would better omit this addition to the
visiting-card, writing the address in any emergency
that requires it. No messages should be written
on a man’s card, and no penciling is allowed, except
as above, to give (or correct) the address,
or in the case of “P. P. C.” cards, sent by
post.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cards for Ladies.</span></h3>

<p>A woman’s name should never appear on a visiting-card
without either “Mrs.” or “Miss” prefixed.
The exception would be in the case of
women who have regularly graduated in theology
or medicine. Such are entitled, like their brothers,
to prefix “Rev.” or “Dr.” to their names.</p>

<p>A married woman’s card is engraved with her
husband’s name, with the prefix “Mrs.” No matter
how “titled” the husband may be, his titles
do not appear on his wife’s visiting-card. The wife
of the President is not “Mrs. President Washington,”
but “Mrs. George Washington.”</p>

<p>A widow may, if she prefers, retain the card engraved
during her husband’s lifetime, unless by so
doing she confuses her identity with that of some
other lady whose husband is still living. It is more
strictly correct for a widow to resume her own
given name, and to have her card so engraved.
An unmarried woman’s card is engraved with her
full name, or the initials of given names, as she
prefers, but always with the prefix “Miss.” The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
address may be engraved or written in the lower
right corner.</p>

<p>If a society woman has a particular day for receiving
calls, that fact is announced in the lower
left corner. If this is engraved, it is understood to
be a fixed custom; if written, it may be a transient
arrangement. If a weekly “at home” day is observed,
the name of the day is engraved, as “Tuesdays.”
This means that during “calling hours”
on any Tuesday the hostess will be found at home.
A holiday, a birthday, a wedding anniversary, or
other event in a friend’s life may be remembered by
sending a card, upon which is penciled “Greeting,”
“Congratulations,” “Best wishes,” or some
similar expression. Such cards may be sent alone,
or may accompany gifts.</p>

<p>Any brief message may be penciled on a woman’s
card, provided the message is sufficiently personal
to partake of the nature of a social courtesy. But
the card message should not be sent when courtesy
requires a note.</p>

<p>In strictly formal circles a young woman, during
her first year in society, pays no visits alone. She
accompanies her mother or chaperon. She has no
separate card, but her name is engraved, or may be
written, beneath that of her mother (or chaperon)
on a card employed for these joint visits. After a
year or so of social experience the young woman
has her separate card, subject to the general rules
for ladies’ cards.</p>

<p>During the first year after marriage cards engraved
thus: “Mr. and Mrs. James Wills Gray,”
may be used by the couple in paying calls, or returning
wedding civilities. Such cards are also
used when jointly sending presents at any time.
For general visiting, after the first year, husband
and wife have separate cards.</p>

<p>Cards are to be left in person in the following
cases: After a first hospitality, whether accepted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
or not; calls of condolence, and after-dinner calls
by cards. In such cases, when personal card-leaving
is impossible, the card is sent by a private
messenger, and an explanation, or apology, sent
by note. Cards of condolence may be sent by mail
by friends at a distance; but not by persons residing
in the near vicinity. In cases where personal
card-leaving is not imperative, cards may be sent
either by messenger or by mail.</p>

<p>Social observance allows a man to delegate the
distribution of his visiting-cards to a near female
relative, whenever it becomes impracticable for
him to attend to the matter personally. Only the
women of his own household, or a relative with
whom he habitually pays visits, can thus represent
him by proxy.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Men’s Dress.</span></h3>

<p>Good clothes are not alone sufficient to gain one
admittance to the better circles of society, but
without them admittance is impossible. When we go
out into the world, it is not sufficient to do as others
do, we must also dress as others dress. The man
is best dressed whose dress attracts least attention.
One’s dress must be seasonable, appropriate, conform
to the prevailing fashion, without going in the
least beyond it, and appear to be comfortable.</p>

<p>To dress well requires sense, taste and refinement.
Dress is a safe index of character, and few
dress really well that would not be considered persons
of culture. The golden rule is to avoid extremes.
The man of sense and taste never wears
anything that is “loud,” flashy, or eccentric; he
yields always to fashion, but is never a slave
to it.</p>

<p>One good suit of clothes does more service than
two cheap suits. The low-priced suit never looks
well, while the high-priced suit looks well to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
last, if kept clean and occasionally pressed into
shape.</p>

<p>Linen is a test of good taste. Shirts should fit
well and be of good quality. Let your collars
always be strictly within the fashion; cuffs should
be no larger than is necessary to admit of slipping
the hand through them when buttoned. Colored
shirts may be worn traveling, in the country, but
most men of taste prefer white. The pattern of
colored shirts should be small and the color quiet.
If the coat, trousers and vest of business and morning
suits are not made of the same cloth, the coat
and vest should be of the same goods, and darker
than the trousers. Men who cannot spend much
money with tailors should always select dark stuffs.
A dark morning suit may be worn on many occasions
where the wearing of a light suit would be
in bad taste.</p>

<p>Single-breasted overcoats, made with a “fly,”
are most worn, and most desirable. A man of taste
always selects for his overcoats dark, quiet colors.
His boots and shoes are made long, broad in the
sole and in the shank, and with a big and only
moderately high heel. Pinched toes are an abomination.
The shoe that does not look comfortable
never looks well. There are many women who
wear shoes that distort the feet and are most uncomfortable;
such shoes, however, are rarely, if
ever, seen on the feet of well-bred ladies.</p>

<p>A man’s hat should be fashionable, and his jewelry
should be good and simple. False jewelry is
vulgar. A watch, to be thoroughly in good taste,
should never be very large, nor very thick, nor
elaborately chased, nor should it have a hunting-case
unless his business or pleasure renders him
liable to break a crystal, when he is out of the easy
reach of a jeweler to replace it. The watch chain
should always be small and the pattern plain. Indeed,
the young man who wears a big elaborate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
chain and attaches it in one of the lower button-holes
of his vest has made an egregious blunder.
Watch chains that go around the neck are no longer
worn. The vest chain should be attached nearly
as high up as it will reach, in a button-hole. If a
locket or seal is worn, it should be very plain. A
man’s ring should be on the third finger of the left
hand. All kinds of rings are worn by men except
cluster rings; they are worn by women only.
Scarf-rings and collar-buttons with settings are in
doubtful taste. Diamond studs are now very little
worn by men of the better sort, and they never
wear them except with full evening dress. Three
studs in a dress shirt are to be preferred to one.
Imitation diamonds are the extreme of vulgarity.</p>

<p>Nowadays, with few exceptions, men wear the
hair very short, and the exceptions are not found
among men of taste. The most artistic and becoming
cut is that that trims the hair very short on the
sides and back of the head, and leaves it comparatively
long on the top, for the reason that a high
head is always more pleasing than a low, broad one.
The “parting” should be high up—in the middle,
if one chooses to put it there. Pomatums and other
inventions of the barbers are no longer used. Most
men look best with a full beard, if it is kept properly
trimmed and is well cared for. A man with
a beard that reaches down over his chest, or a
moustache so long as to be in his way, is a disgusting
object to look on. If a man shaves a part of
the face only, he should shave that part that is
most prominent. A man with a prominent chin
and thin cheeks should shave his chin and let his
beard grow on the sides of his face; on the other
hand, a man with a retreating or a light chin and
full cheeks should shave his cheeks and let his
beard grow on his chin. In short, the beard should
be so trimmed, if worn full, or so cut, if only a
part is worn, as to give regularity to the outline of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the face. Every man, no matter who he is, should
learn to shave himself quickly and well. Shaving
should be as much a part of the regular morning
toilet as the brushing of the hair. Much depends
on having a good strap and knowing how to use it.</p>

<p>The finger nails should be kept moderately long,
and be so cut that they are a little more pointed
than the upper ends of the nails are. They should
not be scraped, and in cutting, care should be taken
not to encroach too much on the angles.</p>

<p>Canes should be strong, plain, stiff, light and
small. Very big canes are in very bad taste,
especially for young men.</p>

<p>A full-dress suit consists of a swallow-tailed coat,
a low, white or black single-breasted vest, black
trousers, a white necktie, a stand-up collar, a high
black hat, and a pair of light kid gloves. This
dress should never be worn until evening, and never
before the dinner hour. A white necktie should
not be worn except with a full-dress suit, save by
clergymen and a few elderly men who never wear
any other color. Black trousers should not be
worn except with a dress coat, save at funerals. A
high hat should not be worn with a sack coat. A
low hat should not be worn with a long coat—a
double-breasted frock, for example. Dark suits are
preferable for Sundays, especially in town, and
light suits should never be worn to church anywhere.
Double-breasted frock coats should always
be black.</p>

<p>At small informal gatherings most men regard
themselves as sufficiently dressed when they wear
black frock coats and dark trousers. At public entertainments
where ladies wear bonnets, the man
who wears a black frock coat, dark trousers, and
light kid gloves is better dressed—because more
appropriately—than he that wears a full-dress suit.</p>

<p>No man who has any regard for the proprieties
will ever appear at table, even at home, whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
there are strangers present or not, or will show
himself to any one with whom he is not on a familiar
footing, in his shirt-sleeves.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Young Lady’s Début.</span></h3>

<p>Social custom, both here and in Europe, has
fixed the time for a girl’s formal introduction to
society as between the ages of seventeen and twenty.
Abroad, the daughter’s début means much more
than with ourselves, and the launching of a clever
and prepossessing young girl into the fitful sea of
social life is quite an important function.</p>

<p>The mother invites only suitable people to her
house, where she may present her daughter to them
as a member of their circle. This act conveys the
information to the polite world that the young lady
has been graduated in all the accomplishments and
knowledge necessary as the equipment of a woman
of society.</p>

<p>Just previous to her formal presentation or début,
her mother and her elder unmarried sisters—if any—pay
visits, or at least leave their own with their
fathers’ and brothers’ cards, upon all acquaintances
whom they intend to invite to be present at the
début. Engraved invitations follow this formality,
and they are issued about ten days previous to the
event. If they are sent by mail, an extra outer
envelope incloses all the invitations that are directed
to one family. If delivered by messenger,
the outer wrap is no longer used. The mail has
become as suitable a method as any for conveying
social messages. One envelope is directed to Mr.
and Mrs. A. If there are more daughters than one,
the address is, “Misses A.,” or, if preferred, “The
Misses A.” Each son receives a separate invitation;
it is the custom. Replies are sent in the names of
the parties addressed on the envelopes. The invitation
is engraved in script, or, if crest or cipher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
be used, it may be placed on the envelope, and is
in form similar to that used for parties. Cards have
been used on which the special purpose of the
party is stated, with the name of the young lady
who is to make her début engraved upon them;
but this is seldom done, and is not considered in
the best possible taste. The following is the formula
if such a card is used:</p>

<div class="bboxc">
MR. AND MRS. B. N. JONES<br />
<i>request the pleasure of presenting their<br />
eldest</i> [or second, etc.,] <i>daughter</i>,<br />
<span class="smcap">Miss Ada Anna</span>,<br />
<i>to</i><br />
...............................................<br />
<i>on Wednesday evening, April 11, at half-past<br />
eight o’clock</i>.<br /><div class="right">No. 2002 Fifth Avenue.</div>
</div>

<p>A preferable method is simply to inclose the card
of the young lady in the envelope containing the
invitation.</p>

<p>The reply is written and forwarded directly, and
corresponds in style to the invitation, in the following
manner:</p>

<div class="bboxc">
MR. AND MRS. E. DE PEYSTER<br />
<i>accept with pleasure</i><br />
<span class="smcap">Mr. and Mrs. B. N. Jones’</span><br />
<i>kind invitation for Wednesday evening,<br />
April 11th</i>.<br />
No. 969 Irving Place.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    March 12th.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></div>

<p>The young ladies use the same form, and commence
their note with “The Misses Jones,” or in
whatever style the invitation is sent to them. Young
gentlemen follow the same custom. Intimate friends
may send flowers on the day of the young girl’s
first appearance, if they please; but it is not an inflexible
custom.</p>

<p>The young lady stands at the left of the mother
during the reception of guests, and is presented to
her elders and to ladies. Of course, welcomes and
brief congratulatory compliments are offered to her
by each guest, and then place is made for the presentation
of others who are arriving. When supper
is announced, the brother or father escorts the
young lady to the table, and the mother follows,
accompanied by some honored gentleman guest.
If the brother takes the young lady in, the father
leads the way with the eldest or most distinguished
lady of the party.</p>

<p>Visits of ceremony paid to the hostess following
this entertainment should include this young lady,
but during her first season in society she has no
card of her own, and does not pay formal visits
alone. If she be the eldest unwed daughter, her
name is engraved as Miss Jones, beneath that of
her mother. If she have elder sisters at home, her
name is engraved as Miss Ada Anna Jones. During
this first season she does not receive visits from
gentlemen without a chaperon under any circumstances.
If her mother be unable to receive with
her, she politely declines a visit. After the first
season, her own separate card may be left, either
alone or with those of other members of her family.
This formality past, she may be considered launched
into the world of social intercourse.</p>

<p>Young gentlemen on the other hand, enter society
without formality, and without much difficulty.
A youth usually begins by endeavoring to
assist his mother at her entertainments, and by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
being an escort to his sisters on informal evening
visits among lady acquaintances where his agreeable
traits win him a future invitation.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Dinner Parties.</span></h3>

<p>Next to a wedding, there is probably no social
duty that taxes to a larger extent the cleverness and
originality of the mistress of a modern household
than a fashionable dinner. As a preliminary step
to such an event, she is careful to catalogue all
the names of those to whom she desires to extend
the hospitalities of her house. From all these she
selects and groups those who will affect each other
pleasantly. The differences in social conditions
often go far toward deciding upon the groups, and
the combinations of guests may be based upon
mental accomplishments, or family connection. In
either case the etiquette is the same.</p>

<p>To give a dinner in honor of some person, or “to
meet” a particular party, as the invitation should
explain (provided the guest be not well-known and
famous), has an especial advantage in that it settles
who shall, and who need not, be present. This is
a simple method of disposing of our first difficulty
when issuing invitations. In such a case the card
of invitation should be in the usual form with the
addition of an extra card as follows:</p>

<div class="bboxc">
TO MEET<br />
<br />
MR. ARTHUR MAYNE,<br />
<br />
<div class="right">Of New Mexico.</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">thus intimating that the dinner is to be given in
his honor. The regular invitation should always
be given in the name of the host or hostess, thus:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<div class="bboxc">
<span class="smcap">Mr. and Mrs. Clarence Fitch</span><br />
<i>request the pleasure of</i><br />
......................................<br />
<i>company at dinner,<br />
on ..................................<br />
at seven o’clock.</i><br />
<div class="left">No. 94 Florida Avenue.</div>
</div>

<p>The custom of engraving the initials, R. S. V. P.
(Answer, if you please), on the lower left-hand corner
is less followed than formerly. Another and
also quite proper form, when the dinner is given in
honor of some distinguished person, is to issue an
invitation in this style:</p>

<div class="bboxc">
MR. AND MRS. CLARENCE FITCH<br />
<i>request the pleasure of</i><br />
<span class="smcap">MR. AND MRS. ROBERT HENDERSON’S</span><br />
<i>company at dinner, on Tuesday,</i><br />
<i>January 12th, at seven o’clock, to meet the</i><br />
<small>HON. MR. AND MRS. GREGORY.</small><br />
<div class="left">No. 94 Florida Avenue.</div>
</div>

<p>The form used in writing an immediate reply is
as follows:</p>

<div class="bboxc">
MR. AND MRS. ROBERT HENDERSON<br />
<i>accept with pleasure</i><br />
<small>MR. AND MRS. CLARENCE FITCH’S</small><br />
<i>invitation to dinner, at seven o’clock, Tuesday<br />
evening, January 12.</i><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></div>

<p class="unindent">If unable to come, the refusal should be worded in
a manner expressive of disappointment. The following
is the popular style:</p>

<div class="bboxc">
<span class="smcap">Mr. and Mrs. Robert Henderson</span><br />
<i>regret that a previous engagement</i><br />
[or illness, or an unfortunate event]<br />
<i>prevents the acceptance of</i><br />
<small>MR. AND MRS. CLARENCE FITCH’S</small><br />
<i>invitation for Tuesday evening, January 12.</i><br />
</div>

<p>The answer, whether affirmative or negative,
should be addressed to the mistress of the house,
and dispatched, if possible, within twenty-four
hours of the receipt of the invitation. Having accepted
an invitation, be punctual. “To be too
late is a crime, and to be too early a blunder.”
You should not fail to arrive within a very few
minutes after the time named, say within five, or
ten at most. Well-bred people, and people that
dine out frequently, make a point of arriving in
good time. It is not well, however, to arrive before
the hour named. On entering the drawing-room,
go and pay your respects to the hostess, then to
the other members of the family, and finally to any
acquaintances present. Do not offer your hand
either to hostess, host, or to any member of the
family; any offer to shake hands should come from
them. On leaving, offer your hand, if you choose,
to those of your entertainers that offered their hands
to you when you arrived. But it is well to confine
your leave-taking to the hostess and host. Do not
go the rounds and take leave of the whole company
individually; such a course is vulgar. If you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
have a lady with you, do not enter the drawing-room
arm in arm nor side by side. The lady, or
ladies will enter slightly in advance.</p>

<p>Gentlemen do not wear gloves at dinner-parties.</p>

<p>Dinner being announced, the hostess gives the
signal to leave the drawing-room. The host or the
hostess choose partners for their guests. Offer either
arm to the lady. In entering at doors a gentleman
takes the lead, until reaching the dining-room,
when he may let the lady pass first. If there are
steps, you may allow the lady to pass first, or you
may go a step or two in advance. If you go down
side by side, give her the side next the wall.</p>

<p>In the dining-room, assist the lady to be seated,
and wait till the other ladies are in place before
taking your seat. The host remains standing until all
are seated. He also selects the places for his guests.</p>

<p>Sit erect and close to the table. Unfold your
napkin and spread it over your lap, or over one knee,
as you prefer. Before being served and during
the intervals between the courses, do not toy with
the knives, forks, or spoons, or with anything on
the table. As soon as helped, begin to eat, but not
hastily. Do not wait till your neighbors are served.</p>

<p>Dinners usually begin with a soup. This, you
should sip from the side of the spoon, without
noise. Not only soup, but everything else eaten
with a spoon should be sipped from its side when
practicable. The plate should never be tilted to
get the last teaspoonful. If the soup is too hot, do
not blow it, but wait till it cools. In eating it sit
upright, and do not rest your forearms on the table.</p>

<p>Fish is eaten with a bit of bread in the left hand
and a fork in the right. Neither soup nor fish is
ever offered twice at a formal dinner.</p>

<p>As the fork is now used almost exclusively to
convey all kinds of food that have any consistency
to the mouth, it is very desirable that one should
know how to use it properly. It should not be used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
in the left hand with the tines pointing upward.
Food conveyed to the mouth with the fork in the
left hand should be taken up either on the point
of the tines, or on their convex side. In the right
hand, the fork may be used with the tines pointing
upward or downward, at will. It need hardly be
said that eating with the knife is a social offence
not to be overlooked.</p>

<p>Eat peas with a dessert spoon, and curry also.
Asparagus may be handled with the fingers of
the left hand; also Saratoga potatoes and olives.
Green corn should be cut from the cob and then
eaten with a fork. Cheese is eaten with a fork, or
is placed, with a knife, on bits of bread and carried
to the mouth with the thumb and finger. Pies and
<i>pâtés</i>, as a rule, are eaten with a fork only. Sometimes
it may be necessary to use a knife to divide
the crust.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">How to Set the Dinner Table.</span></h3>

<p>There is no pleasanter sight than an artistically
set dinner table just before the guests are seated
and the repast is served. To set it is, indeed, an
art of itself. It should first be covered with a mat
of double-faced cotton flannel wide enough to fall
several inches below the edge, all around. This
greatly improves the appearance of the table-cloth,
which can be laid much more smoothly over this
soft foundation. Small table mats for the purpose
of protecting the cloth are not fashionable at present.
The table-cloth should fall about half way to
the floor all around. For a square or extra wide
table a large floral centre-piece, either round or
oblong, is usually chosen, with endless varieties in
its component arrangement. It may be low and
flat, like a floral mat, in the middle of the table,
or may be lofty. Small fringed napkins of different
colors are used with a dessert of fruits. Napkin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
rings are discarded by many hosts. Fancy doylies
of fine linen embroidered with silk are sometimes
brought in with the finger-bowls; but these
are not for utility, the dinner napkin doing service,
while the embroidered doyly adds a dainty bit
of effect to the table decoration. Good quality of
chinaware and artistic glassware are also essential.
Any ostentation in the use of plated ware is vulgar.
But one may take a pride and satisfaction in the
possession of solid silver. Every ambitious house-keeper
will devise ways of securing, little by little,
if not all at once, a neat collection of solid spoons
and forks.</p>

<p>After the floral decorations and possibly a centre-piece
of pond lilies or other flowers have been put
in place, with fruits and bonbons to balance the
flowers, and here and there at convenient points cut
glass decanters of fresh sparkling water, the next
step is the laying of the covers. The courses in
their order are soup, fish, entrees (served on hot
plates), roast (which is carved at the side table),
and game (if in season). The heavy courses
end, the table is swept for crumbs and dessert is
brought in. Finger-bowls and doylies are brought
in on the dessert-plates. Each person at once removes
the bowl and doyly to make ready for whatever
is to be put on the plate. Strong coffee is
served last of all, in small cups, fashion directing
that <i>café noir</i> or black French coffee be used.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Wine Question.</span></h3>

<p>The wine question is one that disturbs many a
dinner-giving family. Shall wine be served or not,
is a growing problem. Society has at last reached
the point where it is not considered a breach of
good form to serve a dinner without wine. Such a
course is sanctioned by the example of many high
social leaders; and when it is the result of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
temperance principle it has the respect of every
diner-out. No lady or gentleman will find fault
with the absence of wine at his host’s table. It is
good form for a host to serve or not serve wine, just
as he chooses. Apollinaris can be made to take the
place of stronger waters, and no embarrassment
follow. The hostess who simply does not offer
wine to any guest under any circumstances, is using
her influence effectively and courageously in the
cause of temperance and in support of Christian
principles.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Notes for Diners.</span></h3>

<p>At a dinner served in courses, it is better, as a
rule, not to take a second supply of anything. It
might delay the dinner.</p>

<p>Bread should be broken, not cut in small pieces.
To butter a large piece of bread and then bite it, as
children do, is something the well-bred never do.</p>

<p>In eating game or poultry do not touch the bones
with your fingers.</p>

<p>Never gesticulate with your knife or fork in your
hand, nor hold them pointing upward, keep them
down on your plate.</p>

<p>A gentleman wears a dress suit at dinner. A lady
wears a handsome gown, “dinner dress” being
“full dress;” differing, however, from the evening
party or reception gown in the kind of fabrics used.</p>

<p>Gloves are removed by both ladies and gentlemen,
after being seated at the table, and they need
not be replaced again during the evening.</p>

<p>Never load up your fork with food until you are
ready to convey it to your mouth.</p>

<p>Never send your knife and fork, or either of
them, on your plate when you send for a second
supply. Do not hold them meanwhile in your
hand, but lay them down, with something under
them—a piece of bread, for example—to protect
the table-cloth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Don’t use a steel knife to cut fruit if there is a
silver one.</p>

<p>Don’t hold your elbows out; keep them close to
your sides.</p>

<p>When you eat fruit that has a pit or a skin that
is not to be swallowed, the pit and skin must be removed
from the mouth with the fingers of the left
hand, or with a spoon or fork in the right.</p>

<p>Tea, coffee, chocolate, etc., are drunk from the
cup and never from the saucer. Never blow your
tea or coffee; wait till it cools.</p>

<p>Don’t tip your chair, nor lounge back in it, nor
hitch up your sleeves, nor call “Waiter!” nor try
to talk with a full mouth, nor masticate so loudly
that others can hear you, nor lay bones or bits of
fruit on the table-cloth, nor pick your teeth at
table. If you must do the last-mentioned, do it unobserved,
if possible. Should you unfortunately
overturn or break anything, make no apology, but
let your regret appear in your face. Never fold
your napkin where you are invited for one meal
only, but lay it loosely on the table. When the
ladies withdraw from the table, the gentlemen rise.
Remain in the drawing-room at least half an
hour after dinner before bidding host and hostess
good-by.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Breakfasts, Luncheons, Teas and Suppers.</span></h3>

<p>These, and all similar entertainments of the “At
Home” order, are much less formal than the dinner
event. The breakfast invitation should read in
the customary form, and at the right hand lower
corner the words:</p>

<div class="center">
“Breakfast at ten o’clock,<br />
March 15.”<br />
</div>

<p>This breakfast should not be elaborate, but dainty
in its food and appointments. The best of everything,
prepared in the choicest of styles, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
nothing heavy, nor excessive in quantity, should be
prepared. Walking costumes are worn by both
gentlemen and ladies, also visiting-gloves, which
are removed at table. The descent from the dressing-room
and greetings between the hostess and
guest are just the same as at a dinner-party.</p>

<p>Suppers are usually gentlemen parties; and from
nine to ten o’clock is the usual time for them to be
served. There are game suppers, fish suppers,
and several other kinds of suppers, each one of
which differs in the appropriate supplies for the
table. But the formalities of the occasion, or,
rather, the informalities, are all of the same kind.
The invitations may be made at interviews, by
friendly notes, or by the host’s visiting-card, with
this, written upon it:</p>

<div class="center">
<small>SUPPER AT TEN O’CLOCK,</small><br />
<i>Thursday, September 16</i>.<br />
</div>

<p>If it is a fish supper, only little food except that
which once lived in the water is provided; salads
and fruits, without a sweet dessert, complete it,
with the addition of coffee.</p>

<p>It was surely a gracious social benefactor who introduced
the afternoon reception which, between the
hours of four and six, summons a host of friends to
cross one’s threshold and meet informally, over a
social cup of tea, each group giving place to others,
none crowding, all at ease, every one accorded a
gracious welcome from the hostess, who thus has
tacitly placed each guest on her evening list for the
season. The afternoon reception is much the same,
whether it be a tea merely, or a musicale, or a literary
occasion. Conversation and the chat of society, the
greeting of friends, the tea and its pleasant accessories,
fill a half-hour or so very pleasantly. When a
musicale is given, it is usually in honor of some
favorite amateur, a pianist, singer or reader. Under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
such conditions the invitation cards should be a
little more explicit, and may state “Music at 4,”
or whatever the feature of the reception or sociable
may be. Tea is served in the same room, when the
guests are few, and in another room if the reception
be crowded. Usually a single table is set, with
coffee or chocolate at one end, and tea at the other,
served by young ladies. To be invited to preside
at the coffee-urn, or tea-kettle, is accounted a high
compliment. The refreshments may be very thin
slices of bread and butter, or wafers, or similar
trifles; but if the occasion approaches the nature of
a formal reception a more elaborate preparation is
made, and bouillon, oysters, salads, ice-cream and
cakes, delicate rolls and bonbons may be offered.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Luncheons.</span></h3>

<p>These are not as popular here as abroad, and the
informal lunch is not yet fully appreciated in this
country. In rural districts it is called early dinner,
or ladies’ dinner; in the city, when the gentlemen
are all down town, it becomes the elaborate ladies’
lunch. The invitations to luncheon are similar to
those of a tea or reception, but the affair itself is
even less formal. All the dishes should be light.
Broiled fish, broiled chicken, broiled ham, broiled
steaks and chops, are always satisfactory. The
house-keeper living near the sea has an ample store
to choose from. The fresh fish, the roast clams,
etc., take the place of the deviled kidneys and
broiled bones of the winter; but every housewife
should study the markets of her neighborhood.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Kettle-Drum.</span></h3>

<p>This is simply a reception under another name,
which is given to signify that the entertainment is
not so pretentious as a formal reception. The name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
“kettle-drum” signifies to a metropolitan resident,
a light entertainment, with <i>demi-toilette</i>
for both ladies and gentlemen. Sometimes a tiny
drum is beaten at intervals in the vicinity of the
tea-table, where a lady of the household or a friend
presides. Sometimes a young lady, costumed prettily
as a <i>vivandiere</i> sits or stands by the tea-urn as
its presiding genius; but these picturesque additions
to an ordinary afternoon reception are not to be
considered in the light of customs, but simply as
pretty caprices, calculated to give vivacity to the
entertainment, which any lady may adopt. Not a
few leaders in society choose the “kettle-drum”
because they dislike general gatherings, or are too
absorbed to assist in entertaining evening guests.
It is simply an “at home” in the daytime, or a
social <i>matinée</i>.</p>


<h3>“<span class="smcap">High Teas.</span>”</h3>

<p>The “High Tea,” as its name indicates, is a more
formal and pretentious entertainment than the ordinary
afternoon tea. Special cards are engraved,
and if any special entertainment is provided, the
fact may be indicated by the words, “Music,” or
“Miscellaneous Program” (when readings and
music are interspersed). Or, the announcement
may be omitted, and the program furnish a pleasant
surprise for the guests.</p>

<p>The card for a “musicale” or similar occasion,
is simply engraved:</p>

<div class="bboxc">
<span class="smcap">Mrs. John Jerolomon<br />
at home</span><br />
<i>Friday, October 11, from<br />
four to seven o’clock.</i><br />
<div class="right">1269 Seventeenth Street.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></div>

<p>For a party or reception given in honor of another,
the invitations should be engraved with a blank
space left for the name of the invited guest; or, the
form may be filled out, and the name of the guest
appear on the envelope only. It may read:</p>

<div class="bboxc">
<span class="smcap">Mr. and Mrs. Andrew Wylie</span><br />
<i>request the pleasure of<br />
.................................’s<br />
company on Tuesday evening, June sixth,<br />

<small>HON. W. W. BRACE.</small><br />
<small>R. S. V. P.</small>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    64 Lark Street.<br />
</div>

<p class="unindent">or, the wording may be “request the pleasure of
your company,” etc. The same form of invitation
can be adapted to almost any reception, party or
other social entertainment, with such variations as
suit the circumstances. If a series of receptions
are to be given, the lower line on the left of the
card may be simply:</p>

<div class="bboxc">
<i>Wednesdays in December,<br />
from three to seven o’clock.</i><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Dancing.</span></h3>

<p>There is no phase of social life that contains so
much of hidden peril as that which relates to
dancing. Of itself, there is nothing sinful in
dancing; but its associations and temptations, and
the tendencies of modern dancing to frivolity, unhealthful
dissipation and immorality are so obvious
as to need no enumeration here. It is a positive
detriment to the spiritual growth of young men and
women, and is prolific of promiscuous acquaintanceships
that cannot be claimed to be safe or desirable
for any young person having a serious
object in life. The ball-room has to many thousands
proved the first step to perdition.</p>

<p>Of dancing, the Rev. Dr. Talmage has said:</p>

<p>“It is the graceful motion of the body adjusted by
art to the sound and measures of musical instrument
or of the human voice. All nations have
danced. The ancients thought that Castor and
Pollux taught the art to the Lacedæmonians. But
whoever started it, all climes have adopted it. In
ancient times they had the festal dance, the military
dance, the mediatorial dance, the bacchanalian
dance, and queens and lords swayed to and fro in
the gardens, and the rough backwoodsman with
this exercise awakened the echo of the forest.
There is something in the sound of lively music to
evoke the movement of the hand and foot, whether
cultured or uncultured. Passing down the street
we unconsciously keep step to the sound of the
brass band, while the Christian in church with his
foot beats time while his soul rises upon some great
harmony. While this is so in civilized lands, the
red men of the forest have their scalp dances, their
green-corn dances, their war dances.</p>

<p>“The exercise was so utterly and completely depraved
in ancient times that the church anathematized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
it. The old Christian fathers expressed themselves
most vehemently against it. St. Chrysostom
says: ‘The feet were not given for dancing but to
walk modestly, not to leap impudently like camels.’
One of the dogmas of the ancient church reads: ‘A
dance is the devil’s possession, and he that entereth
into a dance entereth into his possession. As many
paces as a man makes in dancing, so many paces
does he make to hell.’ Elsewhere the old dogmas
declared this: ‘The woman that singeth in the
dance is the princess of the devil, and those that
answer are her clerks, and the beholders are his
friends, and the music is his bellows, and the fiddlers
are the ministers of the devil. For as when
hogs are strayed, if the hogsherd call one all assemble
together, so when the devil calleth one woman
to sing in the dance, or to play on some musical
instrument, presently all the dancers gather together.’
This indiscriminate and universal denunciation
of the exercise came from the fact that it
was utterly and completely depraved.</p>

<p>“How many people in America have stepped from
the ball-room into the graveyard! Consumptions
and swift neuralgias are close on their track. Amid
many of the glittering scenes of social life in
America diseases stand right and left and balance
and chain. The breath of the sepulchre floats up
through the perfume, and the froth of Death’s lip
bubbles up in the champagne.</p>

<p>“It is the anniversary of Herod’s birthday. The
palace is lighted. The highways leading thereto
are all ablaze with the pomp of invited guests.
Lords, captains, merchant princes, the mighty men
of the land, are coming to mingle in the festivities.
The table is spread with all the luxuries that royal
purveyors can gather. The guests, white-robed
and anointed and perfumed, come in and sit at the
table. Music! The jests evoke roars of laughter.
Riddles are propounded. Repartee is indulged.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Toasts are drank. The brain is befogged. The wit
rolls on into uproar and blasphemy. They are not
satisfied yet. Turn on more light. Pour out more
wine. Music! Sound all the trumpets. Clear the
floor for a dance. Bring in Salome, the beautiful
and accomplished princess. The door opens, and
in bounds the dancer. The lords are enchanted.
Stand back and make room for the brilliant gyrations.
These men never saw such ‘poetry of motion.’
Their souls whirl in the reel and bound with
the bounding feet. Herod forgets crown and throne
and everything but the fascinations of Salome. All
the magnificence of his realm is as nothing now
compared with the splendor that whirls on tiptoe
before him. His body sways from side to side, corresponding
with the motions of the enchantress.
His soul is thrilled with the pulsations of the feet
and bewitched with the taking postures and attitudes
more and more amazing. After awhile he
sits in enchanted silence looking at the flashing,
leaping, bounding beauty, and as the dance closes
and the tinkling cymbals cease to clap and the
thunders of applause that shook the palace begin
to abate, the enchanted monarch swears to the
princely performer: ‘Whatsoever thou shalt ask of
me I will give it thee, to the half of my kingdom.’
At the instigation of her mother, Salome takes advantage
of the extravagant promise of the king
and says, ‘Bring me the head of John the Baptist
on a dinner plate.’ Hark to the sound of feet outside
the door and the clatter of swords. The executioners
are returning from their awful errand.
Open the door. They enter, and they present the
platter to Salome. What is on this platter? A new
glass of wine to continue the uproarious merriment?
No. Something redder and costlier—the
ghastly, bleeding head of John the Baptist, the
death glare still in the eye, the locks dabbled with
the gore, the features still distressed with the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
agony. This woman, who had whirled so gracefully
in the dance, bends over the awful burden
without a shudder.</p>

<p>“In my parish of Philadelphia there was a young
woman brilliant as a spring morning. She gave
her life to the world. She would come to religious
meetings and under conviction would for a little
while begin to pray, and then would rush off again
into the discipleship of the world. She had all the
world could offer of brilliant social position. One day
a flushed and excited messenger asked me to hasten
to her house for she was dying. I entered the
room. There were the physicians, there was the
mother, there lay this disciple of the world. I
asked her some questions in regard to the soul.
She made no answer. I knelt down to pray. I
rose again, and desiring to get some expression in
regard to her eternal interests, I said: ‘Have you
any hope?’ and then for the first her lips moved
in a whisper as she said: ‘No hope!’ Then she
died. The world, she served it, and the world
helped her not in the last.</p>

<p>“With many life is a masquerade ball, and as at
such entertainments gentlemen and ladies put on
the garb of kings and queens or mountebanks or
clowns and at the close put off the disguise, so a
great many pass their whole life in a mask, taking
off the mask at death. While the masquerade ball
of life goes on, they trip merrily over the floor,
gemmed hand is stretched to gemmed hand, gleaming
brow bends to gleaming brow. On with the
dance! Flush and rustle and laughter of immeasurable
merry-making. But after awhile the
languor of death comes on the limbs and blurs
the eye-sight. Lights lower. Floor hollow with
sepulchral echo. Music saddened into a wail. Lights
lower. Now the maskers are only seen in the dim
light. Now the fragrance of the flowers is like the
sickening odor that comes from garlands that have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
lain long in the vaults of cemeteries. Lights lower.
Mists gather in the room. Glasses shake as though
quaked by sullen thunder. Sigh caught in the
curtain. Scarf drops from the shoulder of beauty
a shroud. Lights lower. Over the slippery boards
in dance of death glide jealousies, envies, revenges,
lust, despair, and death. Stench of lamp-wicks
almost extinguished. Torn garlands will not half
cover the ulcerated feet. Choking damps. Chilliness.
Feet still. Hands closed. Voices hushed.
Eyes shut. Lights out.”</p>

<p>The dance must be classed with the wine-cup as
the insidious enemy of a pure, upright, wholesome
society. Pleasant and fascinating at first, it lures its
victims to sacrifice after sacrifice until the end is
reached. No man or woman was ever benefited
morally, intellectually or physically by the dance;
thousands and tens of thousands have found it their
bane, and date their ruin from the first step they
danced to the music across the floor of a lighted
ball-room.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Wedding Etiquette.</span></h3>

<h4><i>Invitations.</i></h4>

<p>Socially considered, marriage is the most important
and imposing of all functions. It gives opportunity
for the greatest display, the most elegant
toilets, and the most lavish and superb manner of
entertainment. Yet singularly enough, the etiquette
of weddings is probably more variable and subject to
innovation than that of any other event in the social
calendar. At no two grand weddings is the etiquette
precisely the same.</p>

<p>Wedding invitations according to present custom
are consigned to the post from two to three weeks
preceding the date of the event. Those sent to
friends and relatives abroad are sent quite three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
weeks earlier. A representative invitation is given
below:</p>

<div class="bboxc">
<span class="smcap">Mr. and Mrs. Charles F. Browne</span><br />
<i>request the honor of your presence<br />
at the marriage of their daughter,</i><br />
<small>EVA MADGE,</small><br />
<i>to</i><br />
<small>MR. SAMUEL MARTIN HOPE,</small><br />
<i>on Wednesday, June the twenty-first,<br />
at twelve o’clock, in<br />
The Church of the Pilgrims.</i><br />
</div>

<p>This is engraved in round-hand script, without
flourish and with little shading, and a tendency
toward the medium and the small in size. The
lines are rather close together, allowing considerable
margin at top and bottom of the note. The
paper most preferred has a white dull kid and parchment
finish, in size between octavo and billet.
When folded it fits an envelope that is almost
square and which offers a choice of either a pointed
or square flap. In town the pointed flap is considered
the proper thing while the country favors the
square one. The envelope inclosing the note is
without gum and of the same weight as the
inclosure, while the outer one, intended as a carrier
only, is of lighter quality and gummed for sealing.</p>

<p>Wedding invitations require no answer. But people
living at a distance, who cannot attend the wedding,
should send their cards by mail, to assure the
hosts that the invitation has been received.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>The usual form of invitation for a wedding reception
is as follows:</p>

<div class="bboxc">
<i>At Home<br />
After the Ceremony,<br />
7 East Market Street</i>—<br />
</div>

<p>This is enclosed, with the cards of the young
bride and of her intended husband, to the favored
ones only.</p>

<p>People with a large acquaintance cannot always
invite all their friends to a wedding reception, and
therefore invite all to the church. Sometimes
people who are to give a small wedding at home
request an answer to the wedding invitation; in
that case, of course, an answer should be sent, and
people should be very careful not to ignore these
flattering invitations. Any carelessness is inexcusable
when so important an event is in view. Bridesmaids,
if prevented by illness or sudden bereavement
from officiating, should notify the bride as soon as
possible, as it is a difficult thing after a bridal program
is arranged to reorganize it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Church Weddings.</span></h3>

<p>We have gradually adopted feature by feature of
the English style of wedding in America until to-day
the general order followed in both countries may
be said, in all essential particulars, to be identical.
The bridegroom is dressed in a frock-coat and light
trousers of any good pattern; in other words, he
wears a formal morning dress, drives to the church
with his best man, and awaits the arrival of the
bride in the vestry-room. He may wear gloves or
not as he chooses. The best man is the intimate
friend, sometimes the brother, of the groom. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
accompanies him to the church, follows him to the
altar, stands at his right hand a little behind him,
and holds his hat during the marriage-service.
After that is ended he pays the minister’s fee, accompanies
the bridal party home, being in a coupé
by himself, and assists the ushers to introduce
friends to the newly wedded pair.</p>

<p>The bridegroom is allowed to make what presents
he pleases to the bride, and to send some gift, such
as a fan, locket, ring or bouquet, to the bridesmaids;
he also buys the wedding-ring, and, of course, sends
a bouquet to the bride; but he is not to furnish cards
or carriages or the wedding breakfast; that is done
by the bride’s family. In England the groom is
expected to drive the bride away in his own carriage,
but in America this custom is not often followed.
The bride, beautifully dressed usually in white
satin, with point lace veil and orange blossoms, is
driven to the church in a carriage with her father,
who gives her away. Her mother and other relatives
precede her and take front seats; her bridesmaids
should also precede her, and await her in
the chancel. The ushers then form the procession
with which almost all city weddings are begun.
The ushers first, two and two; then the bridesmaids,
two and two; then some pretty children—bridesmaids
under ten; and then the bride, leaning on
her father’s right arm. Sometimes the child bridesmaids
precede the others. As the procession reaches
the lowest altar step the ushers break ranks and go to
the right and left and the bridesmaids also go to
right and left, leaving a space for the bridal
pair. As the bride reaches the lowest step the
bridegroom advances, takes her by the right hand,
and conducts her to the altar, where both kneel.
The clergyman signifies to them when to rise, and
then proceeds with the ceremony. The bridal pair
walk down the aisle arm-in-arm, and are conducted
to the carriage and driven home, the rest following.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
In some cases, a bridal register is signed in the
vestry.</p>

<p>Formerly brides removed the whole of the left
glove; now they neatly cut the finger out of the
glove, so that they can remove that without pulling
off the whole glove for the ring.</p>

<p>In a marriage at home, the bridesmaids and best
man are usually dispensed with. The clergyman
enters and faces the company, the bridal pair follow
and face him. After the ceremony the clergyman
retires, and the wedded pair receive congratulations.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Wedding Breakfasts.</span></h3>

<p>The English fashion of a wedding breakfast is not
common here yet, but it is well to describe the
proper etiquette. The gentlemen and ladies invited
should be notified a fortnight in advance, and
should accept or decline immediately, as it has all
the formality of a dinner. On arriving at the
house the gentlemen leave their hats in the hall,
but ladies do not remove their bonnets. After
greeting the bride and groom and the father and
mother, the company talk together until breakfast
is announced. Then the bride and groom go first,
followed by bride’s father with groom’s mother,
then groom’s father with bride’s mother, then best
man with first bridesmaid, then bridesmaids with
attendant gentlemen, and then the other invited
guests, as the bride’s mother arranges. Coffee and tea
are not usually offered, but bouillon, salads, birds,
oysters, and other hot and cold dishes, ices, jellies,
etc., are served at this breakfast, and finally the wedding-cake
is set before the bride, who cuts a slice.</p>

<p>“Stand-up” breakfasts are far more commonly
served, as the French say, <i>en buffet</i>. More guests can
come and it is far less trouble to serve a collation
to a number of people standing about than to furnish
what is really a dinner to a number sitting down.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Home Weddings and Private Weddings.</span></h3>

<p>If the marriage is to be solemnized at home, the
date follows the names in succession, and the place
of residence is given last. The invitation may vary,
“the wedding reception of their daughter,” etc.
Or, accompanying the church wedding invitation
may be a square card bearing the lines: “Reception
from half-past seven until nine o’clock,” with place
of residence on the line below.</p>

<p>If the ceremony is private, the immediate family
and chosen friends are invited verbally. It is then
optional whether or not a formal announcement
shall be made to a wider circle of friends by sending
out engraved cards the day after the ceremony.
These are, like the invitations, printed on note
sheets. The private wedding and after announcement
is often the most suitable method when a bride
is comparatively alone in the world, or has no near
relatives. In such a case the announcement is
worded: “Mr. Walter Edward Brown and Miss
Anna Childers Wilson married; Wednesday, October
twentieth, 619 Grace St.” If no other place is given
this is understood to be the place where to address
cards of congratulation. If the young couple are
to receive later, in a new home, that address, with
date of the “at home,” is also given, thus, “At
home, after November fifteenth, 6417 Ocean Ave.”
If the change of residence is to another town, the
name of the town is also given.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Wedding Gifts and Other Gifts.</span></h3>

<p>There are probably few matters that are the
occasion of more troublesome study and vexation
of spirit than the selection of wedding presents.
They should in all cases be chosen with due reference
to the circumstances of the bride. For the daughter
of wealthy parents, who marries a man of large
means, rare and costly articles are suitable wedding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
gifts. For a bride who is going to housekeeping
on a moderate income, articles that are useful as
well as beautiful are appropriate. A handsome chair,
a china cabinet, or some china to put in it, a few
standard books, fine table linen, or one of the many
other things within the range of house-furnishing
are acceptable.</p>

<p>Presents devised and made by the ingenuity and
labor of the giver—hand-painted screens or china,
embroidered work, or a painting or etching—are
specially complimentary gifts.</p>

<p>A man should not make valuable presents to a
lady outside of his own family, unless she is very
much his senior, and a friend of long standing. A
lady should not accept valuable gifts from a gentleman
unless his relationship to her warrants it. Trifling
tokens of friendship or gallantry—a book, a
bouquet, or a basket of bonbons—are not amiss;
but a lady should not be under obligation to a man
for presents that plainly represent a considerable
money value. When a gift is accepted, the recipient
should not make too obvious haste to return
the compliment, lest he or she seem unwilling to
rest under obligation.</p>

<p>To refuse all trifling favors is regarded as rudeness.
It is often the greatest wisdom as well as kindness,
to allow some one to do us a favor.</p>

<p>When some well-meaning person innocently
offers a gift that strict conventionality would forbid
one to accept, it is sometimes better to suspend the
rules and accept the token, than to hurt the feelings
by refusal.</p>

<p>Gifts of flowers to the convalescent are among
the graceful expressions of courteous interest.
Even a total stranger may send these, without
offending.</p>

<p>Wedding gifts may be sent at any time within
two months before the wedding. All who send
gifts should be asked to the wedding and reception.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Wedding Anniversaries.</span></h3>

<p>It is becoming more and more the custom, both
in town and country, to celebrate wedding anniversaries.
These occasions, however, with a few exceptions,
are usually confined to the exchange of
gifts and expression of good-will by members of
the immediate family. But when a number of
years have passed, a married pair, whose wedded
lives have been harmonious, begin to look forward
to the approach of an anniversary which can be
celebrated by a much wider circle. The marriage
anniversary which falls after five years is sometimes
called “a wooden wedding;” after ten years, “tin;”
after twenty, “crystal;” at twenty-five, “silver;”
at fifty, a “golden anniversary;” and at seventy-five
the “diamond wedding” occurs.</p>

<p>So general has been the custom, in the past, of
making these anniversaries occasions for the making
of gifts of all descriptions that self-respecting
families have at last drawn the line at this
practice and engraved upon their anniversary
invitation cards: “No gifts received.” Still some old
friends will take the liberty sometimes of disregarding
the engraved injunction, just as such valued
individuals indulge themselves in familiarities with
the rules that usually govern one’s private social
affairs. But if remoter relatives or mere society
acquaintances send a gift other than flowers or a
book, after being requested to restrict their generosity,
they need not be surprised if the act be considered
an impertinence, and resented accordingly.</p>

<p>The prevailing style of cards of invitation to an
anniversary party or reception is the same as to
any ordinary entertainment. A wedding-bell, or a
horse-shoe of white flowers, with the date of the
marriage wrought into it with colored blossoms, or
a bride’s loaf dated in sugar and placed upon a
separate table, informs the guests of the reason for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
rejoicing. Here is the correct form of invitation
card for such occasions:</p>

<div class="bboxc">
<span class="smcap">Mr. and Mrs. Alexander J. Marshall</span><br />
<i>request the pleasure of your presence<br />
on Tuesday evening, January eleventh, at<br />
eight o’clock, to celebrate the<br />
twenty-fifth anniversary of their marriage.</i><br />
<div class="right">No. 47 Rylance Street.</div>
<div class="left"><i>No gifts received.</i></div>
</div>

<p>It is customary for the host and hostess to secure
as many guests as possible from among those who
were present at their wedding. The clergyman
who performed the ceremony is bidden, and, if
possible, the wedding-garments are again worn.</p>

<p>Other interesting formalities are added, making
the occasion impressive, without being oppressive.
Near kinspeople offer congratulations first, when
other guests follow after the manner of a wedding
reception. When a formal supper is provided, the
host and hostess lead together upon this peculiar
occasion, and the guests follow in convenient order,
as at an ordinary party. The supper may be in
buffet style, if preferred.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Notes About Weddings.</span></h3>

<p>When a honeymoon follows, the old customs
are still maintained. The father, mother and
intimate friends kiss the bride, and, as the happy
pair drive off, a shower of satin slippers and rice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
follows them. If one slipper alights on the top
of the carriage, luck is assured to them forever.</p>

<p>Many brides nowadays prefer to be married in
traveling dress and hat, and leave immediately
without congratulations.</p>

<p>Wedding-cake is no longer sent about. It is
neatly packed in boxes; each guest takes one, if
she likes, on leaving the house.</p>

<p>Wedding-favors of white ribbon and artificial
flowers are used in England, but not to any great
extent in America. Here the groom wears a
<i>boutonnière</i> of natural flowers.</p>

<p>A widow should never be accompanied by bridesmaids,
or wear a veil or orange-blossoms. She
should wear a colored silk and a bonnet, and be attended
by her father, brother or some near friend.
It is proper for her to remove her first wedding-ring,
as the wearing of that cannot but be painful to the
bridegroom. If married at home, she may wear a
light silk and be bonnetless.</p>

<p>It is an exploded idea that of allowing every one
to kiss the bride. Only near relatives have this
privilege.</p>

<p>Wedding tours are no longer considered obligatory
nor is the seclusion of the honeymoon demanded
by fashionable society.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">New Year’s Day Calls.</span></h3>

<p>The old-time habit of serving wines and liquors
at these gatherings has, happily, almost died out,
in good society. Those who entertain elaborately
upon New Year’s Day sometimes send out cards
of invitation in the name of the hostess. They
are handsomely engraved, and enclosed in a single
envelope. If a daughter or daughters receive
with her, “Miss Blank or Misses Blank” is engraved
beneath her own name. If other ladies
than her daughters also receive with her, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
visiting-card may be enclosed in the same envelope
with the hostess’ invitation. Should the lady-guest
invite her own personal friends to meet her at the
residence of her hostess for this day, she writes the
number of her residence where she is to receive on
New Year’s upon her own card, adding the receiving
hours in ink, and she incloses the visiting-card
of her hostess.</p>

<p>The invitation of the hostess is engraved in the
following form:</p>

<div class="bboxc">
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Wilmer Ralston</span><br />
<small>AT HOME,</small><br />
<i>January first, from one until ten o’clock.</i><br />

No. 679 Little Silver Street.
</div>

<p>All the ladies are in full toilets, and the house is
lighted as if it were evening. A table is spread, as
if for an ordinary reception or party, in the back
parlor or dining-room. A servant opens the street-door
and the gentlemen leave their cards in the
hall. They enter the drawing-room with hat in
hand, or they may leave it in the hall with overcoat
and cane. Ladies in full costume require the
atmosphere of their drawing-rooms to be kept comfortably
warm. They rise to receive their guests.
The hostess offers her hand to the guest when he
enters, and, after an exchange of compliments he
is presented to her lady friends. After partaking of
refreshments, which consist of oysters, tea, coffee,
chocolate, bouillon or lemonade, with cake and
cold meats, boned turkey, etc., he may retire soon
from the house without interrupting his hostess,
provided she be occupied with later visitors. He
need only bow to each lady as he passes out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>Ladies who receive New Year’s callers less formally
may write “January 1” upon their visiting-cards
and send them to such of their gentlemen
acquaintances as they may like to see. They need
not provide an elaborate repast. They may wear
a visiting costume with light gloves, but they need
not turn on the gas, because informal receptions
are held in daylight. If they do not mention upon
their cards the hours for receiving, it is etiquette for
a gentleman to call at any time between twelve m.
and ten o’clock p. m. The formalities between
hostess and guest are the same as if the reception
were held in grand toilet.</p>

<p>Gentlemen who cannot call enclose their visiting-cards
in envelopes, and send them by messengers
on the morning of New Year’s, or by mail the day
before. Others drive from door to door and leave
their cards, the right-hand side folded over to
signify that they delivered the card in person. A
gentleman leaves as many cards as there are ladies
who are old enough to receive visitors.</p>

<p>Gentlemen should wear a morning costume of
dark coat and vest, with lighter pantaloons, when
they pay New Year’s calls. It is not uncommon to
see dress-suits, but they are never strictly correct
until evening. Gloves, while light in tint, should
never be white. Medium tints in scarfs and gloves
are in taste upon these occasions.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Christenings and Birthdays.</span></h3>

<p>There are occasions when family and friendly
reunions of the pleasantest character may be enjoyed.
Christening ceremonials among our superior
citizens are becoming more and more beautiful
each year in New York. The formality which
is most in favor is the giving of a reception; the
hours are fixed from three or four o’clock until six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
p. m. It is equally proper to write the invitations,
or to order them engraved in script.</p>

<p>The engraved form is scarcely varied from the
following:</p>

<div class="bboxc">
<span class="smcap">Mr. and Mrs. William Ashton</span><br />
<i>request the honor of your presence at the<br />
Christening Ceremony<br />
of their son</i> [or daughter] <i>at five o’clock,<br />
Thursday, December sixth.<br />
Reception from four to six o’clock.</i><br />
<div class="right">No. 1624 W. Eleventh Street.</div>
</div>

<p>This card calls for an early response.</p>

<p>At these parties, flowers ornament the house
tastefully. The guests all arrive in reception or
visiting toilets, before five o’clock, and meet the
host and hostess just as they would at any reception.</p>

<p>There may be a band of music, or a pianist and a
quartette of singers, to entertain the guests.</p>

<p>Sometimes professional musicians are employed.
A temporary font is arranged in a prominent place
in the room, and on a small round table is placed a
silver goblet or bowl, or one of crystal. The edge
of the pedestal is often hung with trailing flowers.</p>

<p>The child is brought to the parents, who stand
by the font, and the sponsors join them. If it be a
girl, its selected guardians are usually two young
ladies, who are dressed in white and who arrange
themselves one at each side of the father and
mother, and a hymn or chant is sung. The clergyman
performs the rite according to the formalities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
of his own established church; more music follows,
and then a benediction. Directly after this,
congratulations are offered to the father and mother,
and the child is admired and shortly afterward
removed.</p>

<p>Refreshments are offered as at any afternoon entertainment.</p>

<p>Children’s birthdays are celebrated more and
more after the customs of Europeans. A little feast
is made for the child, to which its companions are
invited, but the invitations seldom extend beyond a
number that may be seated at table. The feast is
dainty but not rich, and with a pretty cake in which
may be placed as many toy wax-candles as there are
years in the age of the young host. They are already
lighted when the young people enter the
room. Plays follow the supper. Guests are not
expected to make presents.</p>

<p>Among the elders of a family the yearly return
of the birthday is seldom celebrated except by his
or her own kinspeople. The twenty-first birthday
of a young man is often made an occasion for a dinner,
or a party, but a lady’s age is not thus publicly
celebrated. When the lady or gentleman becomes
very old, delightful attentions are often
bestowed upon them by their young friends, and
by the companions of their youth. Flowers, letters
of congratulation, cards of inquiry and respect, gifts
that will interest, breakfast or dinner parties, and
receptions, are considered proper for such celebrations.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mourning Etiquette.</span></h3>

<p>Death comes to all alike and custom has long
established a conventional observance in dealing
with the presence of death, in our own homes or
elsewhere. In our own country black is worn as
the typical attire of sorrow, and it has come to be
regarded as a token of respect to the lost one. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
is now decreed that crape shall only be worn six
months, even for the nearest relative, and that the
duration of mourning shall not exceed a year. A
wife’s mourning for her husband is the most conventionally
deep mourning allowed. Bombazine
and crape, a widow’s cap, and a long, thick veil—such
is the modern English idea. Some widows
even have the cap made of black <i>crêpe lisse</i>, but it is
generally of white. In this country a widow’s first
mourning dresses are covered almost entirely with
crape. There are now, however, other and pleasanter
fabrics which also bear the dead black, lustreless
look which is alone considered respectful to the
dead, and which are not so costly as crape or so
disagreeable to wear. The Henrietta cloth and
imperial serges are chosen for heavy winter dresses,
while for those of less weight are tamise cloth,
Bayonnaise, grenadine, nuns’ veiling, and the
American silk.</p>

<p>Mourning is expensive, and often costs a family
more than they can well afford; but it is a sacrifice
that all gladly make. Many consider it an act of
disrespect to the memory of the dead if the living
are not clad in gloomy black.</p>

<p>Widows wear deep mourning, consisting of
woolen stuffs and crape, for about two years, and
sometimes by choice for life. Children wear the
same for parents for one year, and then lighten it
with black silk, trimmed with crape. Half mourning
gradations of gray, purple, or lilac have been
abandoned, and, instead, combinations of black
and white are used. Complimentary mourning is
black silk without crape. The French have three
grades of mourning—deep, ordinary, and half
mourning. In deep mourning, woolen cloths only
are worn; in ordinary mourning, silk and woolen;
in half mourning, gray and violet. In France,
etiquette prescribes mourning for a husband—six
months of deep mourning, six of ordinary, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
six weeks of half mourning. For a wife, a father,
or a mother, six months—three deep and three half
mourning; for a grandparent, two months and a
half of slight mourning; for a brother or a sister,
two months, one of which is in deep mourning; for
an uncle or an aunt, three weeks of ordinary black.
Here, ladies have been known to go into deepest
mourning for their own relatives or those of their
husbands, or for people, perhaps, whom they have
never seen, and have remained for seven or ten
years, constantly in black; then, on losing a child
or a relative dearly loved, they have no extremity
of dress left to express the real grief. Complimentary
mourning should be limited to two or three
weeks.</p>

<p>The duration of a mourner’s retirement from the
world has been much shortened of late. For one
year no formal visiting is undertaken, nor any gayety.
Black is often worn for a husband or wife two
years, for parents one year, and for brothers and
sisters one year; a heavy black is lightened after
that period. Ladies are beginning to wear a small
black gauze veil over the face, and are in the habit
of throwing the heavy crape veil back over the hat.
It is also proper to wear a quiet black dress when
going to a funeral, although not absolutely necessary.
Friends may call on the bereaved family
within a month, not expecting, of course to see
them. Kind notes expressing sympathy are welcome
from intimate friends; and flowers, or any
similar testimonial of sympathy, are thoughtful
and appropriate.</p>

<p>Cards and note-paper are put in mourning, but
very broad borders of black are in bad taste. A
narrow border of black is correct. The use of
handkerchiefs with a two-inch square of white
cambric and a four-inch border of black is to be
deprecated.</p>

<p>Mourning which soldiers, sailors, and courtiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
wear is pathetic and effective. A flag draped with
crape, a gray cadet-sleeve with a black band, or a
piece of crape about the left arm of a senator,
a black weed on a hat, are in proper taste.</p>

<p>For light mourning, jet is used on silk, and makes
a handsome dress.</p>

<p>Elegant dresses are made with jet embroidery on
soft French crape, but lace is never “mourning.”
During half mourning, however, black lace may be
worn on white silk; but this is questionable. Diamond
ornaments set in black enamel are allowed
even in the deepest mourning, and also pearls set
in black. Gold is never worn in mourning.</p>

<p>The Swedish kid glove is now much more in use
for mourning, and the silk glove is made with such
neatness and with such a number of buttons that it
is equally stylish, and much cooler and more agreeable.
Mourning bonnets are worn rather larger
than ordinary bonnets.</p>

<p>People of sense, of course, manage to dress without
going to extremities in either direction. Exaggeration
is to be deprecated in mourning as in
everything. The discarding of mourning should
be effected by slow stages. It shocks persons of
good taste to see a widow change into colors
hurriedly. If black is to be dispensed with, let its
retirement be slowly and gracefully marked by
quiet costumes, as the grief, yielding to time, is
giving way to resignation and cheerfulness.</p>

<p>Before a funeral the ladies of a family see no one
but the most intimate friends. The gentlemen, of
course, see the clergyman and officials who manage
the ceremony. It is now the almost universal
practice to carry the remains to a church, where
the friends of the family can pay the last tribute of
respect without crowding into a private house.
Pall-bearers are invited by note, and assemble
at the house. They, accompanying the remains,
after the ceremonies at the church, to their final<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
resting-place. The nearest lady friends seldom go to
the church or to the grave. This is, however, entirely
a matter of feeling, and they can go if they
wish. After the funeral only the members of the
family return to the house. It is not expected
that a bereaved wife or mother will see any one
other than the members of her family for several
weeks.</p>

<p>All the preparations for a funeral in the house
are committed to the care of an undertaker, who
removes the furniture from the drawing-room, filling
all the space possible with camp-stools. The
clergyman reads the service at the head of the
coffin, the relatives being grouped around. The
body, if not disfigured by disease, is often dressed
in the clothes worn in life, and laid in an open
casket, as if reposing on a sofa, and all friends are
asked to take a last look. The body of a man is
usually dressed in black.</p>

<p>The custom of decorating the coffin with flowers
is beautiful, but has been overdone, and now the
request is frequently made that no flowers be sent.</p>

<p>No one in mourning for a parent, child, brother,
or husband, is expected to be seen at a concert, a
dinner, a party, or at any other place of public
amusement, before three months have passed.
After that one may be seen at a concert. But to
go to the opera, or a dinner, or a party, before six
months have elapsed, is considered heartless and
disrespectful. If one choose, as some do, to wear
no mourning, then he can go, unchallenged, to any
place of amusement, but if he put on mourning he
must respect its etiquette.</p>

<p>A woman may wear mourning all her life if she
choose, but it is a question whether in so doing she
does not injure the welfare and happiness of the
living.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Etiquette of Correspondence.</span></h3>

<p>Good or ill-breeding is no more marked in
general deportment than in the writing of notes
and letters. A gracefully and courteously worded
note is always pleasantly received. Very long
letters are now rendered unnecessary by the increase
of mail and telegraphic facilities, but the
writing of notes has correspondingly increased; and
the last few years have seen a profuse introduction
of crests, ciphers, designs, and monograms in
the corners of ordinary note-paper. The use of
sealing-wax has almost been abandoned, although
it is still the only elegant, formal, and ceremonious
way acknowledged in England, of sealing a
letter.</p>

<p>Colored note-paper fell into disuse long ago, and
for the last few years we have not seen the heavy
tints. Pale greens, grays, blues, and lilacs have
found a place in fashionable stationery, but now
no color that is appreciable is considered stylish,
unless it be <i>écru</i>, a creamy white. Fanciful emblazoned
and colored monograms have been dropped;
the crest and cipher are laid aside, and ladies have
simply the address of their city residence, or the
name of their country place printed in one corner
(generally in color), or, a fac-simile of their initials,
engraved and set across the corner of the note-paper.
The day of the week, also copied from
their own handwriting, is often impressed upon the
square cards now so much in use for short notes, or
on the note-paper. Good, plain, thick, English
note-paper, folded square, put in a square envelope,
and sealed with red sealing-wax is always stylish
in any part of the world.</p>

<p>The plan of having all the note-paper marked
with the address is an excellent one. It gives a
stylish finish to the appearance of the note-paper,
is simple, and useful. The ink should be plain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
black ink, which gives the written characters great
distinctness.</p>

<p>Every lady should study to acquire a free, and
educated hand; a cramped, poor, slovenly, unformed
handwriting is sure to produce a poor impression
upon the reader.</p>

<p>Custom demands that we begin all notes in the
first person, with the formula of “My dear Mrs.
Brown,” and close with “Yours, cordially,” or
“Yours with much regard,” etc. The laws of
etiquette do not permit us to use numerals, as 3, 4,
5, but demand that we write out <i>three</i>, <i>four</i>, <i>five</i>.
No abbreviations are allowed in a note to a friend,
as, “S<sup>d</sup> be glad to see you;” one must write out, “I
should be glad to see you.” The date should follow
the signing of the name. A note in answer to an
invitation should be written in the third person, if
the invitation be in the third person. An acceptance
of a dinner invitation must be written in this
form:</p>

<div class="bboxc">
<span class="smcap">Mr. and Mrs. Green</span><br />
<i>have great pleasure in accepting the polite<br />
invitation of</i><br />
<span class="smcap">Mr. and Mrs. Dinsmore</span><br />
<i>for dinner, on the seventeenth inst., at seven<br />
o’clock.<br />
18 Golden Square.<br />
July sixth.</i><br />
</div>

<p>Above all things, in letter writing, <i>spell correctly</i>.
A word badly spelled stands out like a blot on a
familiar or ceremonious note. Do not send a blurred,
blotted, slovenly note to any one. The fashion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
is not now, as once, imperative that a margin be
left around the edge of the paper. People now
write all over the paper. Do not <i>cross</i> your letters:
such letters are a nuisance to all people who have
not the keenest of eyes.</p>

<p>No letter or note should be written on ruled
paper. Every person should learn to write without
lines. The square cards are much used, and
are quite large enough for the transmission of all
that a lady ordinarily wishes to say in giving or
accepting an invitation. The day of the week and
the address are often printed on the card. Square
envelopes have also driven the long ones from the
table of the elegant note-writer, and the custom of
closing all ceremonious notes with sealing-wax is
still adhered to by the most fastidious. Dates and
numerical designations, such as the number of a
house, may be written in Arabic figures, but quantities
should be expressed in words. Few abbreviations
are respectful. A married lady should always
be addressed with the prefix of her husband’s
Christian name. In this country, it is the custom
to abbreviate everything except the title of “Reverend,”
which we always give to the clergy. A
properly written note honors the writer and the
person to whom it is written, while a careless one
may injure both.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Behavior in Church.</span></h3>

<p>It may not be out of place to furnish a hint as to
behavior in church. There is, of course, such a
thing as church etiquette, although its code is
rather implied than written. As a preliminary, it
should be assumed that the right spirit has drawn
the worshiper thither and that a reverent attention
will be given to the service. The following
suggestion may be accepted as embodying the
general view of church etiquette:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>1. If possible, be in time. You need at least
five minutes after coming to get warm or cool: to
compose your body and mind, and to whisper a
prayer before the service begins.</p>

<p>2. Never pass up the aisle during prayer or
Scripture reading. If you do, your presence will
distract the minds of many in the audience.</p>

<p>3. Be devout in every attitude; all whispering
should be studiously avoided. Find the hymn and
sing it if you can. Share the book with your
neighbor. If in a strange church, conform to its
customs.</p>

<p>4. If the sermon has begun, take a seat near
the door—no matter if you are “at home.”</p>

<p>5. Be thoughtful for the comfort of others.
Take the inside of the pew, if you are the first to
enter, and leave all vacant space at the end next to
the aisle.</p>

<p>6. Speak a bright, cheery word to as many as
possible at the close of the service. If you are a
stranger, ask one of the ushers to introduce you to
the pastor, or to some of the church officers. This
will always insure you a hearty welcome.</p>

<p>7. Never put on your coat, overshoes or wraps
during the closing hymn, and do not make a rush
for the door immediately after the benediction is
pronounced.</p>

<p>8. There should be no loud talking and jesting
after the service is concluded. They are as much
out of place in the house of God as at a house of
mourning.</p>

<h2>VARIOUS POINTS ON DEPORTMENT.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Polite Terms of Address.</span></h3>


<p>Not every one who is accustomed to most of the
usages of good society, is familiar with the approved
forms of address, even in the simplest
matters. A good authority writes:</p>

<p>Say “<i>Thank you</i>,” not “<i>Thanks</i>”—a lazy and
disrespectful abbreviation. If you say “Pardon
me,” let your manner be appropriate to your
words. “I beg your pardon” is sometimes uttered
in prefacing the expression of a contrary opinion,
and the insolence of the tone and manner give the
words all the force of a contradiction. In most
phrases of compliment the words are nothing, the
manner everything. So of adding “Sir” or
“Ma’am” to “Yes” and “No.” “Yes, sir,”
“No, sir,” may be rude and defiant; “Yes” and
“No” may be polite and deferential. There is a
difference of opinion as to whether it is necessary,
or even proper, for people of social equality to add
<i>sir</i> or <i>madam</i> to these responses, and especially as
to whether children should be taught to do so. It
is a provincial custom, but the best usage does not
allow it. Children may be taught to say “Yes”
and “No” with a well-bred courtesy of tone and
inflection to which the additional syllable “Sir”
could give no additional grace. It is an important
point of training in etiquette to enforce the truth
that the <i>spirit</i> of words and deeds is the <i>essence</i> of
good manners, or good <i>anything</i>, in fact.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Faulty Social Training.</span></h3>

<p>That society is bad whose members, however
tenacious they be of forms of etiquette and elaborate
ceremonials, have one code of manners for
those whom they deem their equals, and another
for those whom they esteem to be of less importance
to them by reason of age, pecuniary condition,
or relative social influence, writes Mrs.
Sherwood. Bad manners are apt to prove the
concomitant of a mind and disposition that are
none too good, and the woman who slights and
wounds people because they cannot minister to
her ambitions, challenges criticism of her own
shortcomings. A girl who is impertinent or careless
in her demeanor to her mother or her mother’s
friends; who talks slang; who is careless in her
bearing toward young men; who accepts the attentions
of a man of bad character or dissipated
habits; who is loud in dress or manner—such a
girl must be classed as ill-bred and undesirable in
good society.</p>

<p>So with a young man who is indifferent to his
elders, neglects to acknowledge invitations, sits
while a lady stands, does not speak to his host;
who is selfish, immoral and careless of his reputation.
No matter how rich, or how agreeable to
those he may wish to please, he is to be avoided
by a wise host or hostess.</p>

<p>If a young girl comes from a secluded circle, and
sees some handsome, well dressed woman much
courted, and observes in her what seems to be insolent
pretence, unkindness, frivolity, and superciliousness,
let her inquire and wait before she
accepts her acquaintance. Good society is the
bringing together of the best men and women in a
pleasant and proper way. Good breeding, personal
superiority, beauty, genius, culture, are all
estimable things, and every one likes a person of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
charming manners; but the best society is that of
those who have virtue and good manners combined.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tactful Hostesses.</span></h3>

<p>The capable hostess will give her instructions for
the details of the entertainment so explicitly that
on the arrival of the guests she need have no other
care than their pleasure. If she is nervous, or
shows constraint, it affects the ease of her guests.
Upon the demeanor of the hosts the success of the
occasion largely depends. Much tact may be shown
in placing the right people together at the table.
If one is a great talker let the other be a good
listener; if one is dogmatic let the other be without
positive views, and so on; for every one is happiest
when appearing well. The guests, too, have
their obligations, and in recognition of the compliment
of being invited where the number of
guests is limited to very few, each one should exert
himself to be as agreeable as possible, a dull
dinner or tea companion being a misfortune. At a
dinner there is time, not given at most other forms
of entertainment, for rational and sustained conversation,
and this may be turned to durance vile
if one victimizes by his egotism or caprice the person
who without power of withdrawal is assigned
to his society for perhaps two hours or more. Also,
if one finds himself neighbor to some one he dislikes,
it must not be allowed to interfere with the
general pleasure; and should such a situation occur,
there is nothing to do but to make the best of
it. The discovery is sometimes made that an unfriendly
person is more agreeable than was supposed,
and a pleasanter relationship results.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Young Girl’s Social Life.</span></h3>

<p>Here is a pretty and instructive little sketch by
Ruth Ashmore from her new book on “Sidetalks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
with Girls,” in which she pictures the “Social Life
of a Girl.” She writes:</p>

<p>You are just beginning to go out; you are
twenty years old, and you would like, as is perfectly
natural, not only to have the love of women,
but the genuine admiration of men. The admiration
of all men is not worth having. You believe
that you are pleasant to look at, but when you
meet strangers you are abashed, the blood rushes
to your face, and you don’t know what to say.
Now a little bit of that is due to self-consciousness;
more of it to inexperience. When a man is presented
to you you need not expect to enter into an
easy conversation with him, as does the woman of
forty, but you can get your thoughts away from
yourself and answer him as intelligently as possible.
Make up your mind to be a little slow in
your speech rather than to give a foolish answer,
and after you have resolved to do this you
will not find it difficult to overcome that silly
giggle so peculiar to young women, and which is
very often the result of great nervousness, and an
effort to speak quickly.</p>

<p>Don’t be too perfectly certain about things. The
positive girl who, the very minute a stranger
speaks to her, gives him an answer which she announces
is her opinion, and which she permits no
one else to doubt, is quite as undesirable as the
girl who is afraid to say anything. I think you
will be most successful socially if you are willing
to learn, and if you never permit yourself, from
false shame, to tell an untruth and say you do
know of things about which you are totally ignorant.
Experience has taught most social leaders
that men like to give information, consequently
when a stranger has been presented to you, and
after the first ordinary commonplaces, asks, “Did
you meet the Spanish Princess?” answer yes or
no, as the truth may be, and supplement this by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
another question, “Did you? And what did you
think of her?”</p>

<p>It is not difficult in this world to attract, if one is
young and pleasing to look upon.</p>

<p>It may be taken as a general rule that no woman
can retain her friends who cannot control her
temper. What she thinks may be right, but, because
it is so, no excuse can be found for her going
into a long, quarrelsome argument, raising her
voice, and making her hostess and all the other
guests uncomfortable. Then people must know
that, socially, a girl is to be relied upon; that she
is not going to bring the daily worries of her life
into the social atmosphere, but that she is certain
to bring her mite of agreeableness to add to all the
other mites until the perfection of enjoyment is
achieved, and the pleasant side of everybody is
seen and enjoyed. The woman who wishes to keep
her friends must steer clear of vital subjects on
which they may differ.</p>

<p>Be pleasant and agreeable to all who may be in
your own social world. To retain one’s friends one
must also respect their social rights. That girl
shows wisdom, who, invited to a very elaborate
affair and feeling that she cannot afford even a
simple suitable dress, refuses the invitation rather
than mortify the hostess by being out of tune in
the general harmony. One has achieved a great
wisdom when one has learned how to say “no”
in the social world without giving offence. So it
should be with any games, or any affair involving
late hours, or at which she would meet undesirable
people. The saying “no” is right, but it must be
said at the right time, that is, it must be said before
the temptation arises and before you would
be forced to appear as rude. You cannot accept an
invitation and refuse to meet your hostess’ friends.
Once there, you are bound to be polite to them,
though afterward you need only recognize them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
very faintly, and gradually the recognition may die
away altogether. A form of declination for those
invitations which you are sure will place you either
in disagreeable positions or among people whom
you do not care to meet, is this:</p>

<div class="bboxc">
<p>“<i>Miss Brown thanks Mrs. Charles
Jones for the kind invitation for Wednesday
evening, and regrets her inability to
accept it.</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>At your own home have the parlor the prettiest
and most comfortable room in the house, but don’t
be alone there—have some of the members of the
family with you. Arrange the parlor with a view
of furnishing subjects for conversation. Have
whatever illustrated magazines or papers you have
in view, or any photographs of celebrities; have
the piano open and the music on it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Innocent and Sinful Pleasures.</span></h3>

<p>It is frequently asked: “What pleasures or
recreations may a young man or woman share that
are not objectionable.” There are a thousand innocent
pleasures within easy reach of all. Pleasures
may be classified as, (1) Recreative and helpful; (2)
Harmless and enjoyable but neither helpful nor
otherwise; (3) Injurious for various reasons and objectionable
as being detrimental to spiritual
growth and the development of the finer qualities
in either sex. To the latter category belong
gambling of all sorts, dancing, theatre-going, flirtations
and frivolous companionship, and all pleasures
that merely “kill time” and induce a temporary
excitement. Objectionable pleasures are
never recreative—a term that implies healthful
and upbuilding if not uplifting qualities.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>The greatest tonic, stimulant, and equalizer,
writes Lyman B. Sperry, is genuine pleasure. Contentment,
satisfaction, joy, are remarkable for their
beneficial influence on mind and body. Occupations
that are inviting and pleasurable, whether
they be called work or play, are helpful to human
development, longevity, and efficiency. Diversion,
recreation, pleasure, are demanded as an antidote
to our feelings of depression and fatigue, a stimulant
to our courage, a basis for satisfaction with
life. All must have recreation and amusement in
order to thrive well, but in seeking them it is easy
to find and to follow those which, though apparently,
and perhaps temporarily healthful, are finally
destructive of things good and satisfying. All
amusements which leave a sting, or feelings of
surfeit or of regret, are either essentially unhealthful
(and therefore unjustifiable), or they are used
in such a way as, practically, to make them injurious.
There are some so-called amusements which
are inevitably bad, and there are others which are
bad only when they are intemperately pursued. So
much depends upon the time, the manner, the
amount, the associations, the tendencies of various
forms of activity called amusements, that it is impossible
to classify them rigidly as either commendable
or objectionable. All intelligent persons
must admit that our lives should be conformed to
ways that are helpful to advancement in all that is
really and permanently good.</p>

<p>Amusements should secure <i>rest from irksome toil</i>
and conduce to real recuperation. While they enable
fatigued parts of the body to rest, they should
also bring into action other parts that need, for the
general good of the body, as well as for their own
good, to be called into exercise. Genuine and
healthful amusements stimulate mental emotion in
such a way as to make one forget his burdens and
sorrows, they leave in the consciousness a sweet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
memory which spreads its perfume over and
through the succeeding period of toil, and even
into the toil of one’s neighbors. There should be
no doubt about the <i>effects</i>. Questionable amusements
are usually injurious amusements. Some
really commendable forms may be in bad repute
simply because they are habitually in bad company,
or possibly because of mere prejudice. Each
one should be intelligently examined as to its nature
and influence, and be accepted or rejected
only after a fair judgment is passed upon it.</p>

<p>Comparatively few persons lack opportunities
for amusement, and with many the great question
is what <i>not</i> to do. With so much to select from,
how shall we amuse ourselves? The answer is, <i>In
any way we please</i>—provided, first, that we can
<i>afford</i> it; second, that we find practically that it
furnishes the rest and recuperation we <i>need</i> and
that without leaving a residuum of regret or of
lessened self-respect; third, that our indulgence
does not interfere with the natural rights of others,
or prove a stumbling-block to them; and fourth,
that it is not of such a fascinating nature as to induce
us to consume an undue amount of time and
energy. It requires a goodly stock of intelligence
and conscience to determine, each for himself,
what amusements he shall seek, and where, when,
and how they shall be sought.</p>

<p>The man or the woman who, at the social party
or at the family fireside, plays any kind of a game
<i>for stakes</i>, even though they may be trifling,
thereby kindles and fans a flame that in many cases
becomes unquenchable. The person thus tempted
easily follows his impulses, and rushes into anything
that will either arouse or gratify the love of
excitement.</p>

<p>The <i>moral</i> quality of most forms of amusement
may be determined simply by their <i>physical</i>
effects. So intimately related are mind and body,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
so influential is the conscience over physical
processes, that nothing which the conscience condemns
can be healthful and recuperative. And it
is equally true that every form of physical excess
or of dissipation, inevitably leaves mental recoils
and moral stings.</p>

<p>One of the best men of the day, who has seen
much of life and who has studied many of its
problems, says: “If an amusement sends you
home at night nervous, so that you cannot sleep,
and you rise up in the morning, not because you
are slept out, but because your duties drag you
from your slumbers, you have been where you
ought not to have been. There are amusements
that send a man, next day, to his work, yawning,
stupid, nauseated, and with blood-shot eyes; they
are wrong amusements. There are entertainments
that give a man disgust with the drudgery of life;
with work-tools because they are not swords; with
working aprons because they are not princely
robes; with domestic cattle because they are not
infuriated bulls of the arena. If anything sends
you home longing for a life of thrilling adventure,
for love that takes poison or shoots itself, for moonlight
adventures and hair-breadth escapes, you
may depend upon it you are the sacrificed victim
of unsanctified pleasure. Our recreations are intended
to build us up, and if they pull us down, as
to our moral or as to our physical strength, you
may come to the conclusion that they are obnoxious.”</p>

<p>Wise people judge all so-called amusements by
their actual fruits; by their immediate and their
remote influence on the body, the mind, and the
soul. It is the part of wisdom to cheerfully avoid
all that prove to be dissipating to physical energy,
or degrading to moral character; and the highest
wisdom as clearly dictates that we cheerfully engage
in those things which rest, refresh, and energize
our God-given powers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Treatment of Servants.</span></h3>

<p>There is no surer sign of ill breeding and ill
feeling than the rude treatment of dependents.
The obligation of civility to servants should be inculcated
especially upon the young American, who
ought to learn at the earliest period that the accidental
relation of advantage of position, which is
ever alternating in a country free from prescriptive
right, gives no title to a haughty demeanor and a
domineering conduct. The recognition of the
mutual obligation of master and man, and mistress
and maid, is a certain sign of the true gentleman
and lady, who will never exact from those temporarily
placed in subjection to them the civility they
are unwilling to bestow. The “thank you,”
“please,” and other courteous expressions of a
kindly consideration of the obligation of the employer
to the employed, will be freely proffered
by all who are fully conscious of their social duties
and willing to acknowledge them. Policy, as well
as good breeding, inculcates the necessity of gentle
treatment and courteous behavior to servants, who
will seldom fail to respond with a more zealous
service and a readier obedience to exactions and
commands rendered less harsh and domineering
by a soft word and a subdued mastery.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Management of the Hands.</span></h3>

<p>The management of the hands in company seems
to embarrass young people greatly. This comes
from the false modesty which induces them to suppose
they are the observed of all observers. Let
them think only of themselves in due proportion
of estimate with the vast multitude of mankind, and
frequent habitually the company of the refined,
and they will probably overcome much of their
awkwardness, if they do not acquire a large degree
of grace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Posing for Effect.</span></h3>

<p>To attitudinize, with the view of producing an
impressive effect upon the beholder, seldom succeeds
except with the rawest members of society.
When detected, as it always is by accomplished
people of the world, it creates, at first sight, a
feeling of aversion which it is not easy to eradicate.
This <i>posing</i> for effect is so old a trick, and so easy
of detection, that it is surprising any person who
has reached the years of discretion should attempt
to play it. Yet how often do we see it, in its various
phases of the delicate young lady with the
languid air, the listless step, or <i>die-away</i> posture!—the
literary young lady with the studiously neglected
toilette, the carefully exposed breadth of
forehead, and the ever-present, but seldom read
book!—the abstemious young lady, who surreptitiously
feeds on chops at private lunch, and
starves on a pea at the public dinner!—the humane
young lady, who pulls Tom’s ears and otherwise
tortures brother and sister in the nursery, and does
her utmost to fall into convulsions before company
at sight of a dead fly!—the fastidious young lady,
who faints, should there be an audience to behold
the scene, at the sight of roast goose, but whose
robust appetite vindicates itself by devouring all
that is left of the unclean animal when a private
opportunity will allow. We assure our young
readers that such affectations are not only absurd,
for they are perfectly transparent, but ill bred, as
shams of all kinds essentially are.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Winking and Dozing in Public.</span></h3>

<p>Winking and all knowing glances had better be
left to the horse jockeys and the frequenters of the
bar-rooms, billiard saloon, and gambling-tables.
It would seem hardly necessary to remind any one
of the indecorousness of sleeping in company, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
it must be recollected that the obligation is equally
urgent upon all not to put people to sleep. It is
the duty of every one to be wakeful; it is equally
so to be as little somniferous in matter and manner
as possible. An illustration is given of the
somnolency of Washington Irving, who, according
to the author, D’Israeli, was taken up bodily from
a dinner-table where he had fallen asleep, and did
not awake until set down in the midst of an
evening party.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beautifying the Hands.</span></h3>

<p>Much can be done by care to beautify the fingers,
upon the grace of which depends greatly the beauty
of the whole hand. The natural tapering length
of these can only be preserved by removing from
them all pinching manacles of kid and jewelry.
Much of the beauty of the finger depends upon
the proper treatment of the nails. These, if cut
too close, deform the finger-ends and render them
stubby. The upper and free border of the nail
should always be left projecting a line or so beyond
the extremity of the finger, and be pared only to
a slight curve, without encroaching too much on
the angles. To preserve the half moon, or what
the anatomists call the <i>lunula</i>, which rises just
above the root of the nail, and is esteemed so
great a beauty, care must be taken to keep down
the skin, which constantly tends to encroach upon
it. This should be done with a blunt ivory instrument,
and the growth gently pushed away, but
never cut. By this means, also, the production of
the annoying “hang-nail” will be prevented. The
habit of filing or scraping the nails is fatal to their
perfection, as it thickens their substance and destroys
their natural transparency. The ordinary
finger-brush should alone be used for cleaning and
polishing the nails. The ugly habit of biting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
nails is fatal to their beauty. They become excessively
brittle in consequence, not being allowed
time to acquire their natural toughness, and, moreover,
the ends of the fingers, being unsupported,
turn over, forming an ugly rim of hard flesh,
which will prevent the regular growth of the nail.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Causes of Deformed Feet.</span></h3>

<p>The tight shoe or boot, too narrowly toed, is
exclusively responsible for that painful affection,
<i>ingrowth</i> of the toe-nail. If treated in time, it
can be easily and simply cured. All that is necessary
is to scrape down the nail until it becomes
quite thin, and then cut the projecting edge of it
in a semilunar form, with its concavity looking
outward from the foot. The nail of the great toe
should always be thus pared, care being taken not
to clip the angles. This causes it to grow toward
the centre, and shrink from the tender flesh at the
sides. Chloroform now happily fulfills the service
for the rendering of which this awkward process
was barely a pretext. Though the operation has
thus become painless to the insensible patient, it
has lost none of its horror to the spectator. The
surgeon, grasping the toe, thrusts the sharp-pointed
blade of a pair of scissors under the nail as far as it
will go, and then, cutting it in two, tears out each
half with a pair of pincers from the quivering flesh
in which it has been long imbedded. No one, not
even the slave of fashion, should submit to any
form of the boot or shoe other than the broad-toed,
which is fortunately now in vogue.</p>

<p>The foot, like the hand, is subject to the infirmity
of excessive perspiration. It is to be
remedied by the same general and local treatment.
The habitual daily washing of the feet should be
with cold rather than with warm water, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
powder of starch or arrowroot, which it would be
well to perfume with bitter almonds, orris, or some
other no more intrusive odor, should be sprinkled
in the inside of the stocking.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Care of the Teeth.</span></h3>

<p>A wholesome condition of the teeth is not only
essential to good looks, but to daily comfort and
permanent health. Chewing of the food, so necessary
to a good digestion, cannot be properly
performed with weak and diseased masticators,
which are, in fact, the frequent cause of dyspepsia
and other affections of the stomach. Local diseases
of the most tormenting kind, such as neuralgia
and the various painful face, head, and earaches,
and disorders of the eye, as well as the fatal
cancer and tedious ulcers of the tongue and lips,
are often due to no other cause than a decayed and
ragged tooth.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Awkwardness in Sitting.</span></h3>

<p>Many ladies, by not bending the knees, render
their walk very ungraceful. The posture, moreover,
if too rigid, particularly in sitting, has an
exceedingly ugly look. Some folks are unable to
sit on a chair, though they have so many opportunities
of learning how to do it. While some
never fairly get on a seat but to their own manifest
discomfort, and that of all who look upon their
misery, poise and balance themselves on the sharp
edge, there are others who roll their bodies up into
heaps, as it were, and throw them with an audible
bounce deep into the receptacle, whatever it may
be. Every one seating himself should take his
place deliberately, and so completely that he may
feel the full repose of the chair, which it is designed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
to give. The limbs, once at rest, should be moved,
if moved at all, as noiselessly as possible; and all
extraordinary actions, such as lifting, for example,
one leg high upon the other, and holding it there
manacled by a grasp of the hand, should be
avoided. A person striding a chair, and grinding
his teeth, and thrumming his hands on the back,
has by no means an elegant look to the observer
before or behind. This practice, which is never
becoming in any company, is simply indecent in
that of women.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">About Blushing.</span></h3>

<p>Blushing, which, as a sign of modesty, may be
commendable in the young, especially of the female
sex, is by no means always pleasing and worthy of
encouragement. When immoderate and inopportune,
it becomes a social nuisance. There is a false
shame, which is the very reverse of true modesty.
The usual signs of the fictitious quality are shyness,
with the common accompaniments of frequent
and ill-timed blushing, hesitancy of speech, hanging
of the head, downcast eyes, sidelong glances,
shambling and stumbling gait, restlessness of posture,
and a general air of voluntary shrinkage, if
we may be allowed the term. This false modesty
is the result of a genuine vanity, which, overestimating
self, fancies it the object of universal attention.
This naturally begets a sensitiveness and an
anxiety about personal appearance so great that
they embarrass the whole behavior; for these excessively
vain persons, fancying all eyes constantly
upon them, would desire to make a figure in society
of which they are manifestly incapable. Of this
they are the first to become conscious, and their
hopelessness of success is painted in strong colors
upon the face, and visibly impressed upon every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
limb and feature. There are persons who live to
an advanced life, and yet retain this fault. It has
often proved fatal to the social qualities of some
who have been otherwise singularly well adapted
not only to receive from society, but to bestow upon
it, both distinction and happiness.</p>

<h2>STRAY HINTS.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Enjoy the Present Hour.</span></h3>


<p>There is an Eastern legend of a powerful genii,
who promised a beautiful maiden a gift of rare value
if she would pass through a field of corn and, without
pausing, going backward, or wandering hither
and thither, select the largest and ripest ear,—the
value of the gift to be in proportion to the size and
perfection of the ear she should choose. She passed
through the field, seeing a great many well worth
gathering, but always hoping to find a larger and
more perfect one, she passed them all by, when,
coming to a part of the field where the stalks grew
more stunted, she disdained to take one from these,
and so came through to the other side without
having selected any. This little fable is a faithful
picture of many lives, which are rejecting the good
things in their way and within their reach, for
something before them for which they vainly hope,
but will never secure. On a dark night and in a
dangerous place, where the footing is insecure, a
lantern in the hand is worth a dozen stars. It is
well to look beyond the present into the future, and
in the season of strength and prosperity, to make
provision for a time when misfortune and old age
may overtake us. But this does not mean that we
should ignore the present altogether, nor that our
pleasures should consist solely in the anticipation
of some future prosperity or expected success.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Make Home Attractive.</span></h3>

<p>Some one has said that the three sweetest words
in our language are, “Mother, Home and Heaven.”
We may well pity that being so unfortunate as not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
to have enjoyed the blessings of a happy home, for
in the battle of life we need to be armed with the
counsels and prayers of a mother, and all holy and
sweet home influences, if we are to successfully
meet the snares and perils which will beset us.
Home is the paradise in which this wonderful world
is first revealed to our growing consciousness, and
as from its safe shelter we look out upon life we
form our estimate of it according to the impressions
and teachings we there receive. If the home is
brightened with the sunshine of love, its radiance
is reflected in all around us, and the whole world
appears to us only as one family,—full of kind
thoughts, tender sympathies, gentle ministrations
and noble deeds. If the home life is sour, gloomy
and unhappy, then we see the whole world through
the same atmosphere of misery and discontent;
and it is to us only a dull, dismal prison, crowded
with selfish souls, whose petty strifes and base
actions cause perpetual turmoils and unhappiness.</p>

<p>Parents, depend upon it, you have no holier nor
higher work to do than to make home attractive.
In after years your endeavors will be repaid a
hundred fold by the grateful affection, the happy
memories, and the noble lives of your children,
who, whatever their success elsewhere, will ever
turn to the old homestead and its inmates as the
Mecca of their earthly pilgrimage.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Sunny Temper.</span></h3>

<p>If it were possible for us to invoke the aid of
some powerful genii, who, as we passed through
life, could summon troops of loving friends around
us, and make our pathway radiant with their
smiles and blessings, we should think no labor too
arduous, no sacrifice too great to procure such inestimable
happiness. If such a beneficent fairy
held court and dispensed such favors, though she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
dwelt in the uttermost parts of the earth, what
caravans of eager pilgrims would throng to that
favorite realm! We often forget that the priceless
charm which will secure to us all these desirable
gifts is within our reach. It is the charm of a
sunny temper,—a talisman more potent than station,
more precious than gold, more to be desired
than fine rubies. It is an aroma, whose fragrance
fills the air with the odors of Paradise. It is an
amulet, at sight of which dark clouds of perplexity
and hideous shapes of discord flee away. It
wreathes the face with smiles, creates friends, promotes
cheerfulness, awakens tenderness, and scatters
happiness. It fills the heart with joy, it robs
sorrow of its pain and makes of earth a very heaven
below.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Value of Female Society to Man.</span></h3>

<p>One of the most marked men of this century,
Disraeli, who achieved distinction in many different
lines of thought and action, toward the close
of a career of extraordinary success, made the remarkable
statement that “a female friend, amiable,
clever and devoted, is a possession more valuable
than parks and palaces, and without such a
nurse, few men can succeed in life,—none be content.”
The reason why multitudes of gifted and
brilliant men fail in their career, is for want of the
very traits of character which female society would
impart. How many men are intellectual, well informed,
and possess a complete practical knowledge
of the pursuit they enter upon! but they are
<i>brusque</i>, imperious, and overbearing; they lack the
urbanity of demeanor, the consideration of others’
feelings, the gracefulness of expression, which are
necessary to conciliate men and to draw them to
themselves; and for the need of these qualities
their progress is impeded, or they fail in their plans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
altogether. The female character possesses those
qualities in which most men are deficient,—the
delicate instincts, the acute perceptions, the ready
judgment, the wonderful intuitions,—these all
belong to her by native right, and are usually
acquired by men through her influence.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Home Maxims.</span></h3>

<p>The following maxims, if put in practice daily,
would do much to promote harmony and good
feeling in the home:</p>

<p>“Never make a remark at the expense of the
other; it is meanness.”</p>

<p>“Never manifest anger.”</p>

<p>“Never speak loud to one another, unless the
house is on fire.”</p>

<p>“Never reflect on a past action which was done
with a good motive, and with the best judgment.”</p>

<p>“Never part without loving words to think of
during your absence. Besides, it may be that you
will not meet again in life.”</p>

<p>“Let each one strive to yield oftenest to the
wishes of the other, which is the mutual cultivation
of an absolute unselfishness.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">True Politeness.</span></h3>

<p>Politeness has been called the oil which makes
the wheels of society run smoothly; and certainly
it does greatly lessen the friction of daily contact
with each other. Keen perceptions, a wise discernment,
and a natural power of imitation, with
much contact with the world, are the essential requirements
of polished manners. It has been said
“that the best bred man is he who is possessed of
dignified ease, to reconcile him to all situations
and society.” This is not attained so much from a
knowledge of the rules of etiquette, as by an innate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
nobility of character, a greatness of soul, and
proper self-respect. True politeness is never the
product merely of punctilious conformity to established
usages, although it is necessary to have a
knowledge of these, but rather of an overflowing
kindness of heart, a generosity of spirit, and a
sacred regard for the golden rule. Indeed, the
grand foundation on which the etiquette of all civilized
countries is based, is that of doing to others
as you would they should do unto you, and in preferring
others to yourself.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mock Modesty.</span></h3>

<p>A proper sense of modesty is a virtue which
makes real merit more charming, because seemingly
unconscious of excellence. But carried to an
excess it will tend to dwarf the powers, cripple the
energies and defeat the great purposes of life. When
a man is well qualified to do a certain thing, and
feels that he can and ought to do it, but is impelled
by modesty to shrink back into obscurity
for fear of bringing himself into notice, then has
his modesty degenerated into cowardice, and instead
of consoling himself that he is cherishing a
great virtue, he needs the lash of stern rebuke for
his lack of manliness. One of the most charming
of essayists, says: “I have noticed that under the
notion of modesty men have indulged themselves
in a spiritless sheepishness, and been forever lost
to themselves, their families, their friends and their
country. I have said often, modesty must be an
act of the will, and yet it always implies self-denial,
for if a man has a desire to do what is laudable for
him to perform, and from an unmanly bashfulness
shrinks away and lets his merit languish in silence,
he ought not to be angry with the world that a more
unskillful actor succeeds in his part, because he has
not confidence to come upon the stage himself.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Art of Conversation.</span></h3>

<p>To converse well requires more than mere information
or knowledge, combined with a ready
facility of expression. There must also be sound
judgment and a good heart, for without these all
other triumphs are hollow and delusive. Our conversation
should be such as will be agreeable to
others; the subject of it should be appropriate to
the time, place and company, and we should avoid
all bitterness, all thoughtless criticisms, all unseemly
ridicule, and the heartlessness which wounds
the feelings and disturbs the peace of those who
listen to us,—and then our presence will be welcomed,
and we shall diffuse pleasure and promote
friendship. All the resources of tact and wisdom
may be summoned into action in the exercise of
our colloquial powers. An ancient philosopher
made it a rule to divide the day into several parts,
appointing each part to its proper engagement, and
one of these was devoted to <i>silence wherein to
study what to say</i>. What innumerable heart-burnings;
what a multitude of quarrels; what a host
of local feuds would be avoided, if this wise rule
were universally followed!</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">When “Small-Talk” is Timely.</span></h3>

<p>One of the first requisites of conversation is to
have something worth saying. Lowell once said,
“Blessed are they who have nothing to say, and
cannot be persuaded to say it;” and another remarked,
“There are few wild beasts to be dreaded
more than a communicative man with nothing to
communicate.” Clearly, this might be aimed at the
small-talk habits of some.</p>

<p>Carlyle, in his rugged, vigorous style, expresses
himself quite as strongly to the same point: “Thou
who wearest that cunning, heaven-made organ, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
tongue, think well of this: Speak not, I passionately
entreat thee, till thy thought have silently
matured itself, till thou have other than mad and
mad-making noises to emit; <i>hold thy tongue</i> till
<i>some</i> meaning lie behind it to set it wagging. Consider
the significance of <span class="smcap">Silence</span>; it is boundless,—never
by meditating to be exhausted; unspeakably
profitable to thee! Cease that chaotic hub-bub
wherein thy own soul runs to waste, to confused
suicidal dislocation and stupor; out of silence
comes strength.”</p>

<p>The ground-work of conversation is knowledge
of the subject under consideration, and without
this words are but useless sounds. Yet there are
conditions in which a vigorous flow of “small-talk,”
we talk with no particular object or value.
Live to enliven and keep in good humor, is most
desirable.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Monopolizing Talkers.</span></h3>

<p>An eminent clergyman once administered this
rebuke to a young lady, who absorbed the entire
time of the company by her small talk:
“Madam, before you withdraw, I have one piece
of advice to give you, and that is, when you go
into company again, after you have talked half an
hour without intermission, I recommend it to you
to stop awhile, and see if any other of the company
has anything to say.” There are few persons of
such rare learning and ability that one can afford,
when in their company, to be only a listener.
There is a Chinese proverb that “a single conversation
across the table with a wise man is better
than ten years’ study with books.” But how comparatively
few good talkers there are, and how
lightly is the art esteemed. And yet, will it not
always be true that “Words fitly spoken are like
apples of gold in pictures of silver?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Point on Being Well Dressed.</span></h3>

<p>A celebrated English divine once said to a lady:
“Madam, so dress and so conduct yourself, that
persons who have been in your company shall not
recollect what you had on.” To be well dressed
does not necessarily mean that your apparel should
be a copy of the latest whim of fashion, or made
of the costliest material. That person is well
dressed whose attire shows a suitableness to circumstances
of time and place, and the position and
means of the wearer. Neglect and inattention to
the small externals of dress should be carefully
guarded against.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Enjoy Your Youth.</span></h3>

<p>Youth comes to us but once; it is the season
of golden hopes, of overflowing spirits and of
joyous anticipations, and so it demands surroundings
suited to these emotions. You may require
no recreation but such as your business and daily
toil supply; your mind may be absorbed in your
plans and schemes, which appear to you of almost
as much importance as the affairs of an empire,
and with this you are satisfied; but, if so, your
eyes are not young eyes, and your heart must have
long ago been dead to the voices of your youth, to
expect that your children will be contented and
happy, unless you respond to some of the impulses
of their joyous natures. If you have not already
the refining power of music in your little circle,
procure a piano or organ, and encourage your
children to sing and play. Surround yourself with
a little social circle of your own. Adorn your
walls with pictures and thus cultivate a love of
art; subscribe to a standard magazine or two, and
provide them with such books as will give them
glimpses of what is going on in the world around
them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Superior Hostess.</span></h3>

<p>A superior hostess does not make her house a
spectacle. She infuses into her hospitalities the
charm of comfort and purity, the sweetness of
friendship, the sacredness of the relation between
the entertainer and the entertained; and between
herself and even the humblest of her guests there
is a recognizable tie which is as dissimilar to that
which fastens her interest to another guest as its
variation is charming.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Useful Hint.</span></h3>

<p>At an evening visit or entertainment, if the invited
person departs before the usual and specified
hour, he and she should omit formal adieus, if
possible, to avoid putting the thoughts of an unusually
early departure into the minds of other
guests; but if an unnoticed departure is impossible,
the leave-taking should be quietly done, the
hostess expressing her regret at the early departure,
but on no account can she request a delay that
some necessity has demanded. It would be as unkind
as it would be indelicate to urge a guest to
inconvenience himself for the sake of keeping a
crowd intact at a fashionable crush, or even at a
small party.</p>

<h2>HOW TO AMUSE.</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 445px;">
<img src="images/i_093.jpg" width="445" height="249" alt="egg on upside down plate" />
</div>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Dancing Egg.</span></h3>


<p>Place the egg (which should be hard-boiled,
not raw) upon the under-side of a smooth tray,
and move the tray round and round horizontally,
gradually increasing in speed. The egg, resting
in the middle of the tray, is carried round and
round by the movement, and gradually begins to
revolve on its own axis, faster and faster, till at
last it is seen to rise on end, and spin away exactly
as a top would do.</p>

<p>In all experiments involving egg-balancing,
you will find it a material aid to success to keep
the egg upright in the saucepan while it is being
boiled. The air-chamber will, in such case, be
kept central with the longer axis of the egg, which
will in consequence be much more easily balanced.</p>

<p>To set the egg spinning as above described demands
a considerable amount of practice, not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
mention some strength, and, still more, address.
For the benefit of those who may prefer to succeed
at the first attempt, I will indicate a simpler plan
of proceeding:—</p>

<p>Place the tray on the table, letting it project so
far over the edge as to be readily and rapidly
grasped by the hand. Place the egg in the middle,
and with the thumb of the left and the first finger
of the right hand placed at opposite ends, set it
vigorously spinning. It will immediately rise on
end, still spinning. Quickly seize the tray, and
you will then have nothing to do but to keep the
egg still rotating, which is a very easy matter.
This is done by moving the tray in horizontal
circles, but in the reverse direction to that in
which the egg revolves.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Old Family Coach.</span></h3>

<p>Miss Annie and Clara and the Little Dog decided
to take a ride in the Family Coach, so,
whip in hand, the fat Coachman shut the Door,
mounted the box, the Little Dog barked, when
they entered the Family Coach, and almost fell
among the Wheels. Miss Clara and Annie scolded
the Coachman for being so careless in starting the
Family Coach too soon, and putting the Little Dog
in danger of falling among the Wheels. Finally
the Coachman cracked his whip and the Family
Coach started in good shape, the Little Dog barking
furiously. Everything went well with the
Family Coach for a few miles, till the Coachman
spied a pretty girl on the road. He kept looking
after her and did not see that he was putting the
Family Coach and horses in danger, when crash!
went the Family Coach. Miss Clara and Miss
Annie screamed, the Little Dog barked; the Coachman
shouted, the Wheels went in different directions,
and the Axle, the Whiffle Tree and all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
parts of the Family Coach were left in a heap in
the road, in care of the Coachman, while Miss
Clara, Miss Annie and the Little Dog went home
on foot. Such were the adventures of the Family
Coach.</p>

<p>Assemble the company, and give to each one of
the names that are capitalized in the first paragraph,
four being Wheels, two Axles, one the
Whiffle Tree and one the Door, the names of the
ladies to two, and select the tallest person in the
room for the Little Dog. After all the names of
all the parts are given, some one stands in the
middle of the floor and reads the Adventures of
the Family Coach.</p>

<p>Each time the Family Coach is mentioned every
one in the room should rise, turn around three
times, and sit down again. When the wheels are
mentioned, four persons bearing the names of
Wheels also rise, turn around three times, and sit
down. The Little Dog barks, the Coachman
shouts, the two ladies bow when their names
(Miss Clara and Miss Annie), are called. There
is great fun when the Little Dog is called on repeatedly
to rise, turn, and sit down again. When
the Horses are mentioned four persons also rise,
turn around, etc., and so until disaster overtakes
the Coach. This game causes much merriment,
and general good feeling.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Game of Quotations.</span></h3>

<p>All the members of the company being seated,
each is provided with pencil and paper. Some
one gives a quotation, while the other players write
the speaker’s name upon their papers, and opposite
it the name of the author from whom they
believe he has quoted. After each in turn has
given a quotation, the papers are collected and
re-distributed, care being taken that no one shall
receive his own. Then each repeats the quotation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
originally given, this time adding the name of
the author; the other players correcting meanwhile
the papers held by them. The person who
has given the largest number of authors correctly
wins a prize. For example, the first player rises
and says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Colors seen by candle-light</div>
<div class="verse">Do not look the same by day.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The next says:</p>

<div class="center">
Handsome is that handsome does.<br />
</div>

<p>And so on until all have given quotations.
When the papers are exchanged, No. 1, again rising
says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Colors seen by candle-light</div>
<div class="verse">Do not look the same by day.</div>
<div class="sig2">Mrs. Browning.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>No. 2:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Handsome is that handsome does.</div>
<div class="sig2">Goldsmith.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And so on through the list. If any player has
substituted some other name for Browning or
Goldsmith, or has failed to write the name of any
author, it must be marked as incorrect. One
player then collects and compares all the papers
and announces the winner of the contest.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Crambo.</span></h3>

<p>Each member of the party is provided with
paper and pencil, also with two small cards or
slips of paper, upon one of which is to be written
a question and on the other a single word. The
questions and words are collected separately and
re-distributed, whereupon each player must answer
in rhyme the question he has drawn, introducing
into the rhyme the word on the other card. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
time is limited to five minutes, and when this has
expired, each reads aloud the result of his labors,
first giving the question and word received. To
make the game more interesting it is sometimes
required that the word received shall be made a
rhyming word. Here is an example: A writes
for his question “Where is the end of the rainbow?”
and for his single word “goose.” In the
allotted time he writes the following:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">You ask where the end of the rainbow is found;</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Just answer yourself if you can, sir.</span></div>
<div class="verse">For “anser” in Latin in English means “goose,”</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I’m not such a goose as to answer.</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Pictured Quotations.</span></h3>

<p>At the top of a half sheet of paper (each player
having one), a picture is rudely drawn illustrating
some quotation. When all the drawings are finished
each player passes his paper to his right-hand
neighbor, who writes his interpretation of
the picture at the bottom of the paper, turning
the paper over to conceal the writing and passing
it on to the next player. When each has written
on all the papers and they have returned to their
owners, they are unfolded and their contents read
aloud, the correct quotation being given last. As
an instance, A draws a casement window through
which is seen a face gazing at a cluster of stars.
The paper is passed to No. 1, and he writes as his
interpretation:</p>

<div class="center">
In the prison cell I sit, thinking mother dear of you.<br />
</div>

<p>No. 2 writes:</p>

<div class="center">
Mabel, little Mabel, with her face against the pane.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>None guess correctly, so A explains that it
illustrates this couplet from Tennyson’s “Locksley
Hall:”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Many a night from yonder ivied casement ere I went to rest,</div>
<div class="verse">Have I looked on great Orion sloping slowly toward the West.</div>
</div>
</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cross Questions.</span></h3>

<p>The company is divided into two equal parts,
and blank cards and pencils are distributed. One
side writes questions on any subject desired, while
the other prepares in like manner a set of hap-hazard
answers. The question cards are then collected
and distributed to the players on the other
side, while their answers are divided among the
questioners. The leader holding a question then
reads it aloud, the first player on the other side
reading the answer he holds. Some of the answers
are highly amusing.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Game of Rhymes.</span></h3>

<p>A variation of the former game. The game is
begun by a young lady or gentleman speaking a
single line, to which the next nearest on the left
must respond with another line to rhyme with the
first. The next player gives a new line, of the
same length, and the fourth supplies a rhyme in
turn, and so on. The game is provocative of any
amount of fun and nonsense. A sample may be
given.</p>

<p>1st Player.—I think I see a brindle cow.</p>

<p>2d Player.—It’s nothing but your dad’s bow
wow.</p>

<p>3d Player.—He is chasing our black Tommy cat.</p>

<p>4th Player.—Poor puss had best get out of that,
etc.</p>

<p>Any amount of nonsense may be indulged in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
game of this sort, within proper limits. Clever
players can easily give the game a most interesting
turn and provoke rhymes that are original
and witty. Thus, a subject once started, every phase
of it may be touched upon before the round closes.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 443px;">
<img src="images/i_099.jpg" width="443" height="270" alt="Five Straw Puzzle" />
</div>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Five-Straw Puzzle.</span></h3>

<p>You are supplied with five straws of equal length
(about three and a half inches), and you are required
to lift all five, holding only the tip of one
of them. A glance will show you the arrangement
of the five little straws and the coin in their centre,
which is, as will be seen, as simple as possible—when
you know it. The use of the coin is
an optional addition. It wedges all tight, and
prevents the straws slipping when once put
together; but it is by no means indispensable.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">French Rhymes.</span></h3>

<p>Each member of the company writes upon a
slip of paper two words that rhyme. These are
collected by one player and read aloud, and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
they are read everybody writes them down upon
new papers. Five or ten minutes being allowed,
each player must write a poem introducing all the
rhyming words in their original pairs. At the
expiration of the given time the lines are read
aloud. Suppose the words given are “man and
than,” “drops and copse,” “went and intent,”
etc., these are easily framed into something like
this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Once on a time a brooklet drops,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">With splash and dash, through a shady copse;</span></div>
<div class="verse">One day there chanced to pass a man,</div>
<div class="verse">Who, deeming water better than</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cider, down by the brooklet went,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">To dip some up was his intent.</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Of course the result is nonsense, but it is pleasant
nonsense, and may be kept up indefinitely, to
the entertainment of the participants.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Where’s Your Letter Going?</span></h3>

<p>All being seated, two of the company are chosen,
one for postmaster, the other for carrier. The
Postmaster gives the name of some city to each
person, writing the names down upon paper as
they are given. The carrier, blindfolded, stands
in the middle of the room and the postman calls:
“I have a letter to go from Philadelphia to St.
Louis.”</p>

<p>As the names are mentioned, the persons representing
these cities change places, the carrier at
the same time trying to catch one of them. If he
succeeds, and can, while blindfolded, give the
name of the captured player, the latter becomes
carrier in turn. When the postman says: “I have
letters to go all over the world,” everybody rises
and changes places, and if in the confusion the
carrier captures a seat, the player who remains
standing becomes carrier in turn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 356px;">
<img src="images/i_101.jpg" width="356" height="600" alt="Pear held above two crossed knives" />
</div>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Divided Pear.</span></h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Problem: To find the position in which a knife
must be held that a pear, suspended high up near
to the ceiling, shall, on the severing of the thread
to which it is attached, so fall as to cut itself in
half upon the blade. There is no necessity for
line or plummet; we need only dip the suspended
pear in a glass of water, which we forthwith remove.
The water drips from it; we note the exact
spot on floor or table where the drops fall, and
make a private mark on such spot.</p>

<p>This is done privately beforehand, so that the
company, on their arrival, find the pear suspended
in readiness for the feat, and know nothing of
the tell-tale “drop.”</p>

<p>At the proper moment you hold the knife, edge
upward, immediately over the point which you
have marked, while some one applies a lighted
match to the thread. If you have duly followed
our instructions, the pear, in falling, should cut
itself in half upon the blade.</p>

<p>For the experiment as above described one knife
only is used; but it may also be performed with
two knives, as shown in our illustration.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Game of Bouquet.</span></h3>

<p>Each player composes in turn a bouquet of three
different flowers, that he names aloud to the person
conducting the play. The leader then writes
the names of the flowers, and after them the
names of three persons in the room. He then
demands of the player who has composed the
bouquet, what he intends doing with the flowers,
and upon their proposed disposition being declared,
the names of the three persons they represent
are read aloud.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Example.</span></h4>

<p>Leader.—“Miss A, choose three flowers.”</p>

<p>Miss A.—“A rose, an aster and a pansy.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>L.—“I have written them. Now what will you
do with the rose?”</p>

<p>A.—“I will throw it out of the window.”</p>

<p>L.—“And the aster?”</p>

<p>A.—“I will put it in a vase.”</p>

<p>L.—“And the pansy?”</p>

<p>A.—“I will always keep it near me.”</p>

<p>L.—“Very well. You have thrown Mr. A out of
the window, put Mr. B in a vase and expressed a
desire to keep Mr. C always near you.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The All-Around Story Game.</span></h3>

<p>This is a very entertaining game and productive
of general merriment, if conducted at all cleverly
by the players. One person in the room begins
to relate a story, and after telling enough to interest
his hearers and arouse their curiosity, suddenly
breaking off, throws a knotted handkerchief at
some other member of the party, calling upon
him to continue the narrative. This is kept up
as long as possible, the more absurd and improbable
the plot of the story the better. If any one
fails to respond upon receiving the handkerchief,
he or she must pay a forfeit.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tongue-Twisters.</span></h3>

<p>The amusing game of tongue-twisters is played
thus: The leader gives out a sentence (one of the
following), and each repeats it in turn, any player
who gets tangled up in the pronunciation, having
to pay forfeit.</p>

<p>A haddock! a haddock! a black-spotted haddock,
a black spot on the black back of the black-spotted
haddock.</p>

<p>She sells sea shells.</p>

<p>She stood at the door of Mr. Smith’s fish-sauce
shop, welcoming him in.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>The flesh of freshly fried flying fish.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">To Balance a Pencil on its Point.</span></h3>

<p>Dig the blade of a half open penknife into a
pencil, a little above the point, and to open or
close the blade, little by little, till you find that
the balance is obtained. The combination of pencil
and penknife thus placing itself in equilibrio
is an illustration of a familiar law of mechanics;
the centre of gravity of the combination falls below<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the point of support (the finger, edge of the table,
or the like), and thus stable equilibrium is obtained.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 453px;">
<img src="images/i_105.jpg" width="453" height="587" alt="Balancing pencil being cut by knife" />
</div>

<p>By varying the degree of opening of the penknife,
you impart corresponding degrees of inclination
to the pencil. When the centre of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
gravity of the two combined falls in the same line
as the axis of the pencil, the latter will assume a
perpendicular position.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">My Grandfather’s Trunk.</span></h3>

<p>A great game for young folks of a winter evening.
The company being seated in a circle, somebody
begins by saying, for instance:</p>

<p>No. 1. “I pack my grandfather’s trunk with a
pair of spectacles.”</p>

<p>No. 2. “I pack my grandfather’s trunk with a
pair of spectacles and a silk hat.”</p>

<p>No. 3. “I pack my grandfather’s trunk with a
pair of spectacles, a silk hat and a dime novel.”
And so on, each person repeating all the articles
already mentioned, beside adding a new one.</p>

<p>If any one fails to repeat the list correctly, he
drops out of the game, which is continued until
the contents of the trunk are unanimously declared
too numerous to remember.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">How, When and Where.</span></h3>

<p>One member of the company leaving the room,
a word admitting of more than one interpretation
is chosen by the others. On his return, he asks
each in succession, “How do you like it?” The
player questioned being required to give an appropriate
answer. He then inquires in similar manner,
“When do you like it?” and if the answer
to that question still give him no clue, proceeds
to ask, “Where do you like it?”</p>

<p>When he at last discovers the word, the person
whose answer has furnished him with the most
information, must in turn leave the room and
become the questioner.</p>

<p>We will suppose the word chosen to be “rain,”
which can also be taken as “reign” or “rein.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>The question “How do you like it?” receives
the answers “tight,” “heavy,” “short,”
“warm,” etc.</p>

<p>The question “When do you like it?” “In
summer,” “When I am driving,” “In the nineteenth
century,” etc.</p>

<p>“Where do you like it?” “In England,” “On
a horse,” “In the sky,” etc.</p>


<h3>“<span class="smcap">I Love My Love.</span>”</h3>

<p>A pretty game and a prime favorite with country
lads and lasses. The leader commences by
saying, “I love my love with an ‘A’ because she
is Angelic, because her name is Araminta and
because she lives in Atlanta. I will give her an
Amethyst, feed her upon Almonds and make her
a bouquet of Anemones.” The next player, taking
the letter “B,” loves his love in the same set
of phrases, only because she is Bewitching, her
name is Belinda, etc. The next takes “C,” and
so on through the alphabet, omitting the letter X.</p>

<p>Any one failing to supply the required words
promptly gives a forfeit.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Drive a Needle Through a Cent.</span></h3>

<p>To drive a needle through a cent, particularly
if the needle be a fine one, seems at first sight an
impossibility. It is, however, a very easy matter,
if you set about it in the right way. Thrust the
needle through a cork, allowing the point to project
slightly, and then, with a pair of cutting-pliers,
nip off all that remains exposed at the
opposite end. Place cork and cent as shown in our
illustration, or simply let the coin rest on a piece
of soft wood, and hammer away vigorously on the
top of the cork.</p>

<p>The needle, being steel, is harder than the
bronze of the coin, and the cork preventing it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
from bending to either side, it may be driven
through the cent, or any other coin of like substance,
with perfect ease.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 448px;">
<img src="images/i_108.jpg" width="448" height="348" alt="Hammer on cork" />
</div>

<p>The cork should be kept in position with the
left hand, while receiving the blows of the hammer.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Proverbs.</span></h3>

<p>This game requires the players to be alert and
on the watch for the words that give the clue to
the solution. One player (A) having gone from
the room, a proverb is selected by the others, of
which each person takes a separate word, in
order. The absent player then being recalled, proceeds
to question the others singly, each introducing
in his answer the word of the proverb he has
previously received. Suppose the proverb selected
to be “Nothing venture nothing have,” the game
would proceed thus:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>A. “Is the proverb a long one?”</p>

<p>1st Player. “Nothing should be too long for you
to guess.”</p>

<p>A. “Have you ever played this game before?”</p>

<p>2d P. “Really I cannot venture to say.”</p>

<p>A. “Are you fond of parlor games?”</p>

<p>3d P. “Nothing pleases me more.”</p>

<p>A. “Are you enjoying yourself this evening?”</p>

<p>4th P. “I have enjoyed myself thus far.”</p>

<p>If A has not by this time guessed the proverb,
he continues his questions until enlightened, when
the player whose answer has given him the most
information goes from the room.</p>

<p>Rather a noisy way of playing the same game
is to have all the players at a given signal shout
their words in unison, leaving the listener to distinguish
in the uproar some word that shall give
him a clue to the proverb. The shouting is
repeated as often as desired until he is successful.</p>

<p>In either modification of the game the player
whose answer or word leads the questioner to discovery
becomes the one to go from the room.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tossing The Rings.</span></h3>

<p>Fasten securely a stick two feet long and an inch
or more in diameter to the centre of a block of
wood or piece of board, so that the block forms a
substantial base for the stick, which should be
slightly tapered at its upper end. Make out of
wire six hoops or rings, three of them nine inches
in diameter, two of them seven inches, and one
five inches. They should be heavy enough to toss
easily, perhaps half an inch in thickness. Wind
these with cloth torn into strips, fastening the
ends with needle and thread. Use three colors of
the cloth, the rings of each size being the same
color. Red, white and blue make a pretty combination,
using red for the largest size, white for
the next, and blue for the one small one. Now set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the standard at some distance from the players,
and the game begins. One player takes all the
rings and tosses them one at a time over the upright
stick. For each of the large rings which
he succeeds in getting upon the standard, he
counts ten; for each of the next size, fifteen; and
for the smallest one, twenty-five. Any number
agreed upon may be called a game, and the player
first obtaining that number of counts wins. After
one player has thrown all the rings, another player
takes them, tossing them in the same way. Any
number of players may take part in the game.
When once around, the first one tosses again, and
so on until the game is out. For small children,
five or six feet is far enough to toss the rings, but
larger ones may increase the distance.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 454px;">
<img src="images/i_110.jpg" width="454" height="305" alt="drawing a magic figure" />
</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Magic Figures.</span></h3>

<p>Upon a little square of ordinary writing-paper,
sketch some geometrical figure—square, rectangle,
triangle, polygon, etc.—using for that purpose a
pencil whose tip has been moistened with water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Float the paper, with the design upward, on the
water in a basin, and fill up with water the figure
you have traced. With a little care you may do
this without difficulty, for the lines of moisture
which form the outlines of your figure (a triangle,
we will suppose) will prevent the liquid overpassing
the limits thereby defined. The water thus
enclosed will rise in a little heap. Now take a
pin, and placing the point at any spot you please
within the triangle, in such manner that the point
dips into the water but does not touch the paper
itself, you will see the paper begin to move horizontally
in a straight line until the geometric
centre of the triangle places itself exactly under
the point of the pin. You can readily determine
beforehand this central point, which we will call
A, and holding the pin as shown in the engraving,
you will find that the paper travels in the
direction shown by the arrow, till A comes just
under the point of the pin, when it will stop of
its own accord. Repeat the experiment with a
square or a rectangle, and you will find that the
spot which is beneath the pin-point, when the
paper comes to a standstill, is precisely the point
of intersection of the two diagonals.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Force of the Breath.</span></h3>

<p>When you blow into a paper bag in order to
swell it out, afterward bursting it with a blow to
produce the familiar “bang,” have you ever
stopped to ask yourself what was the precise force
of your breath? You know that such force can be
measured by the instrument known as the spirometer,
which you occasionally see at a railway
station or a country fair. But a simple paper bag
may be made to answer the purpose of the spirometer,
as I propose to explain.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 447px;">
<img src="images/i_112.jpg" width="447" height="308" alt="blowing over large books" />
</div>

<p>The bag must be rather long and narrow, airtight,
and of thin, tough paper. A bullock’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
bladder will answer the purpose still better. A
tube should be inserted in the neck, through
which to blow. Lay it flat, near the edge of a
table, with the mouth turned toward yourself;
place various weights upon it, increasing by degrees,
and you will be surprised at the weight that
your breath will thus lift. To upset a couple of
big dictionaries, placed one upon the other, will
be mere child’s play, as you will find on putting
the matter to the test.</p>



<h3><span class="smcap">Hunt the Ring.</span></h3>

<p>All the players stand in a circle holding a long
cord, which forms an endless band upon which a
ring has been slipped before it was joined at the
ends. This ring is passed rapidly from one player
to another—always on the cord and concealed by
the hand—while somebody in the centre endeavors
to seize the hands of the person who holds it, who
when actually caught takes his place within the
circle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>If the circle is very large two rings may be
slipped upon the cord, and two players placed in
the centre together.</p>

<p>A small key may be used instead of a ring, while
still another variation is to have the concealed
object a small whistle with a ring attached. When
this is adopted an amusing phase of the game is
to secretly attach a string to the whistle and fasten
this to the back of the player in the centre by
means of a bent pin at the other end of the string.
Then while feigning to pass the whistle from hand
to hand, it is occasionally seized and blown upon
by some one in the ring, toward whom the victim
is at that moment turning his back, causing that
individual to be greatly puzzled.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Shadow Buff.</span></h3>

<p>A sheet being stretched across one end of the
room, one of the players is seated upon a low stool
facing it and with his eyes fixed upon it. The
only light in the room must be a lamp placed
upon a table in the centre of the room. Between
this lamp and the person on the stool, the players
pass in succession, their shadows being thrown
upon the sheet in strong relief. The victim of
the moment endeavors to identify the other players
by their respective shadows, and if he succeeds
the detected party must take his place.</p>

<p>It is allowable to make detection as difficult as
possible by means of any available disguise that
does not conceal the whole person, any grimacing,
contortion of form, etc.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Magic Music.</span></h3>

<p>A beautiful game, which amuses even the mere
spectator as much as it does the actual players.
One of the company sits at the piano while another
leaves the room. The rest of the party then hide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
some article previously agreed upon and recall the
absent player. At his entrance the pianist begins
playing some lively air very softly; keeping up a
sort of musical commentary upon his search, playing
louder as he approaches the goal, and softer
when he wanders away from it. In this way he
is guided to at last discover the object of his
search.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Going to Jerusalem.</span></h3>

<p>This is another piano game, but does not require
so much skill as the former. One person goes to
the piano, while the others arrange in a line as
many chairs, less one, as there are players; the
chairs alternately facing opposite directions. Then
as the pianist begins to play, the others commence
marching around the line of chairs, keeping time
to the music. When this suddenly ceases, everybody
tries to sit down, but as there is one less
chair than players, somebody is left standing and
must remain out of the game. Then another chair
is removed and the march continued, until the
chairs decrease to one and the players to two.</p>

<p>Whoever of these succeeds in seating himself
as the music stops, has won the game.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bean-Bags.</span></h3>

<p>A game of skill, the equivalent of parlor quoits.
It is played with bean-bags and a board three feet
long and two feet wide, elevated at one end by
another board to an angle of thirty degrees, and
having some six inches from the top an opening
about five inches square. Station this board at
one end of a long room and divide the company
equally. Eight bean-bags are all that are required.</p>

<p>The leader of one side begins. Standing at a
suitable distance from the board, he endeavors to
throw the bags, one at a time, through the square
opening. Every bag that reaches the goal counts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
ten, every one that lodges upon the board five,
and every one that falls to the ground outside of
the board a loss of ten.</p>

<p>Suppose A to have put two bags through the
opening (twenty), and two upon the board (ten),—that
is a gain of thirty—but the other four bags
falling to the ground makes a loss of forty, so his
real score is a loss of ten.</p>

<p>B puts four through the opening (forty), three
upon the board (fifteen), and one upon the ground
(ten), which gives him a gain of forty-five.</p>

<p>The sides play alternately, and after three rounds
for each, the scores, which have been carefully
kept by one member of the party, are balanced,
and the side having the greatest gain declared
winners.</p>

<p>A prize may be given for the highest individual
score.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Throwing the Handkerchief.</span></h3>

<p>A very old and still quite popular game. The
company being seated around the room in a circle,
some one stationed in the centre throws an
unfolded handkerchief to one of the seated players.
Whoever receives it must instantly throw it
to some one else, and so on, while the person in
the centre endeavors to catch the handkerchief in
its passage from one player to another. If he
catches it, as it touches somebody, that person
must take his place in the centre. If it is caught
in the air the player whose hands it last left enters
the circle.</p>

<p>The handkerchief must not be knotted or
twisted, but thrown loosely.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Blind-Man’s Buff.</span></h3>

<p>A player is led blindfolded into the middle of
the room, taken by the shoulders, and turned
around three times, after which he must catch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
somebody to replace him. As he is being turned,
the others say:</p>

<p>“How many horses have you in your father’s
stable?”</p>

<p>“Three; black, white and gray.”</p>

<p>“Turn about, and turn about, and catch whom
you may.”</p>

<p>This game belongs to many countries, and is
known by many different names. It is “Blind
Cow” in Germany; “Blind Goat” in Sweden;
“Blind Mouse” in South Germany and Servia;
“Blind Hen” in Spain; “Blind Fly,” or “Blind
Cat,” in Italy. To the English name, “Blind-man’s
Buff,” correspond the Polish “Blind Old
Man,” and the Norwegian “Blind Thief.”</p>

<p>A familiar variation makes this a ring-game.
The blindfolded person stands in the centre, with
a staff, while the ring circles about him. When
he strikes the floor three times, the ring must
pause. The person in whose direction he points
must grasp the staff, and utter some sound, disguising
the voice as much as possible. The first
must then guess the name from the sound. This
form of the game is called “Peg in the Ring.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Queer Candlestick.</span></h3>

<p>Take a short piece of candle, and into its lower
end thrust, by way of ballast, a nail. You should
choose a nail of such a size that the candle-end
shall be all but immersed, the water just rising
to its upper edge, though not so high as to overflow
the top and wet the wick. Now, light the
candle, and you may safely make a wager that, in
spite of the apparently unfavorable circumstances
in which it is placed, it will burn completely to
the end.</p>

<p>This may, at first sight, appear a rash assertion,
but after a little reflection, you will see how the
arrangement works. The candle, of course, grows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
shorter as it burns, and it seems therefore as if
the water must overflow the top and reach the
wick; but on the other hand, it grows proportionately
lighter, and therefore rides higher in the
water.</p>

<p>Further, the external surface of the candle, kept
cool by the surrounding liquid, melts much more
slowly than it would in the open air, so that the
flame hollows out for itself a sort of little well, as
represented in the right-hand corner of our illustration.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 449px;">
<img src="images/i_117.jpg" width="449" height="342" alt="candle burining in glass of water" />
</div>

<p>This hollowing process further lightens the
candle, and the wick will, as you have stated,
burn to the very end.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Weigh a Letter with a Broomstick.</span></h3>

<p>For the purpose of weighing light objects as,
for instance, a letter, a very delicate balance is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
required; and as such we recommend to our readers
our new broomstick letter-weighing machine.
Cut off the end of an ordinary broom-handle, to a
length of about ten inches, and plunge it into a
tall glass jar full of water—first, however, weighting
it at bottom in such manner that about seven
inches of its length shall be under water. Attach
to the upper end, by means of a tack, an ordinary
visiting card. This will form the tray or scale of
the apparatus—and behold your weighing-machine,
complete. All that remains to be done
is to graduate it. Place on the scale a one-ounce
weight, note how far the stick sinks, and mark
thereon, with a very black pencil, the point where
it meets the surface of the water.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 251px;">
<img src="images/i_118.jpg" width="251" height="434" alt="card on broomstick in jar" />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>The apparatus being so far graduated, take off
the weight, and lay on the card, in its stead, the
letter you desire to weigh. If the pencil mark
remains above the surface of the water, your letter
weighs less than an ounce, and two cents will pay
the postage; if, on the contrary, the mark sinks
below the surface, your letter is over-weight, and
you must pay accordingly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Tailless Donkey.</span></h3>

<p>An amusing game at which any size of party
may play and enjoy it for hours. Cut a large figure
of a donkey, minus a tail, from dark paper
or cloth, and pin it upon a sheet stretched tightly
across a door-way. Each player is given a piece
of paper, which would fit the donkey for a tail,
if applied. On each tail is written the name of
the person holding it. When all is ready, the
players are blindfolded in turn—placed facing the
donkey a few steps back in the room—then turned
around rapidly two or three times and told to
advance with the tail held at arm’s length, and
with a pin previously inserted in the end, attach
it to the figure of the donkey wherever they first
touch it. When the whole curtain is adorned with
tails—(not to mention all the furniture, family
portraits, etc., in the vicinity)—and there are no
more to pin on, the person who has succeeded in
fastening the appendage the nearest to its natural
dwelling place, receives a prize, and the player
who has given the most eccentric position to the
tail entrusted to his care, receives the “booby”
prize, generally some gift of a nature to cause a
good-humored laugh.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boston.</span></h3>

<p>This is a variation of “Blind Man’s Buff,”
which is described elsewhere. Seat the company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
round the room and give each a number. Blindfold
one person and station him in the centre of
the room, twirling him around several times so
that he may successfully “lose his bearings.” He
must then call any two numbers included in the
number of players, and the two people representing
them must at once rise and change places,
while the “blind man” endeavors to seize one of
them. If he succeeds in doing this he must,
while still blindfolded, identify the captive, who
then in turn enters the circle.</p>

<p>More than two numbers may be called at once,
and when the “blind man” calls out “Boston!”
and everybody changes places, he may, by slipping
into a vacant seat during the confusion, find a
substitute in the person left standing when all the
chairs are occupied.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">What is Your Age?</span></h3>

<p>It is always a delicate thing to inquire a lady’s
age, but the question in this game will offend
nobody. There must be at least two people in the
secret, and one of them leaves the room. Somebody
in the company tells his age to the others,
and the absent player is recalled. Everybody is
at liberty to question him, but he only pays attention
to the one player he knows holds the secret
of the game, and from the first letters of the words
introducing the remarks of this person he takes
his cue—the first ten letters of the alphabet standing
for the ten figures, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0.</p>

<p>A goes from the room and B asks for somebody’s
age. C volunteers, “I am twenty-five.” A being
then recalled, there is a universal demand from
the company for the required age, and a great deal
of doubt expressed as to his ability to guess it.
During the general confusion, B hastily says:
“Be sure before you speak,” and then again:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
“Enough thinking. Tell us now.” Whereupon,
A, guided by the first letter, “b,” of the first
remark, and the “e” of the second, which he
knows represents the digits “two” and “five”
respectively, quickly says “twenty-five.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">What, Sir? Me, Sir?</span></h3>

<p>One player says to another:</p>

<p>“Mr. Brown, I saw you on Broadway.”</p>

<p>Whereupon Mr. Brown says:</p>

<p>“What, sir? Me, sir?”</p>

<p>The other replies:</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; you, sir.”</p>

<p>“Oh! no, sir, not I, sir.”</p>

<p>“Who then, sir?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Smith, sir.”</p>

<p>Mr. Smith immediately replies:</p>

<p>“What, sir? Me, sir?”</p>

<p>And so on till each is mentioned in turn.
Those who miss must pay a forfeit. At the end
of the game all the forfeits are redeemed.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Horse.</span></h3>

<p>The players are seated around the room. One
person pretends to whisper to each of the others
in turn the name of a different animal. After
naming them all, he must call out the name of
some one animal, and the person having that
name must run out at the door. Having given
the whole company the name of horse, he calls
horse whereupon they all make a simultaneous
rush for the door. A narrow door should be
chosen, if possible.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rooster.</span></h3>

<p>This is a short game, reaching a quick conclusion
and exciting a hearty laugh. Tell everybody
in the room that you will give to each in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
whisper, the name of some animal, whose peculiar
cry they are to imitate in concert at a given
signal. To all but one person the simple charge
to “keep perfectly silent” is given. Upon that
one is bestowed the name of “Rooster.” Then
saying, “All be ready when I say three!” Count
“one, two, three,” when a lusty crow from the
victim of the joke, and a laugh from the others,
tell him that the general amusement has been at
his expense.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Consequences.</span></h3>

<p>The players are each provided with a slip of
paper and a pencil. Each must write the name of
some gentleman (who is known to the party), turn
down the end of the paper on which the name is
written, and pass the paper to the next neighbor.
All must then write the name of some lady (also
known), then change the papers again and write
“where they met,” “what he said,” “what she
said,” “what the world said,” and “the consequences,”
always passing the papers on. When
all are written, each player must then read his
paper.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones..........</p>

<p>And Miss Smith.....</p>

<p>Met on a roof........</p>

<p>He said, “I trust you are not afraid.”</p>

<p>She said, “Not while you are here.”</p>

<p>World said, “It’s a match.”</p>

<p>Consequences, “He sailed for Africa next
morning,” etc.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mesmerizing.</span></h3>

<p>This may be made very amusing, although no
actual mesmerism is attempted. A member of the
party announces that he has been declared to
possess a vast amount of mesmeric power; not
enough to gain absolute control over a person, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
sufficient to at least prevent him from rising from
a chair alone. His challenge being accepted by
some one, he seats his victim in a low chair and
himself in a higher one close at hand. Then,
solemnly demanding a complete relaxation of will
power and a sober countenance on the part of the
subject, he begins making passes with his hands,
stroking the forehead of the person beside him,
and otherwise imitating a genuine mesmerist.
After a short time he quietly says:</p>

<p>“Now see if you can get up alone!”</p>

<p>Of course, the subject rises to his feet at once,
but so does the mesmerist, thus proving to the
former that having risen simultaneously with
himself, he has surely failed to rise alone.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Guessing Eyes and Noses.</span></h3>

<p>A sheet is fastened up between two doors. Holes
are cut in it, and some of the party go behind the
sheet and stand with their eyes at the holes, while
the others must guess to whom the eyes belong.
Failing to guess correctly they must give a forfeit.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beast, Bird or Fish.</span></h3>

<p>The players sit round in a circle, and one player,
who is “it,” points to some one, and says
either “beast,” “bird,” or “fish.” He then
counts ten as quickly as possible. The person
pointed to must name some “beast,” “bird,” or
“fish” (whichever he was asked) before ten is
reached. If he fails, he must give a forfeit.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Truth.</span></h3>

<p>The players pile up their hands, choose a number,
and draw out in turn, and the person who
draws his or her hand from the pile at the number
selected has to answer truly any questions put
by the rest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

</div>
<h3><span class="smcap">Needles and Pins Made to Float.</span></h3>

<p>Take an ordinary pin, thoroughly dry. This is
an object which water can moisten, but less easily
than glass. If, by some means or other, you can
manage to lay it on the water without wetting it,
you will see the water take a convex shape on
either side of the pin, and this latter, displacing
a proportionate body of water, will float on the
surface, just as a lucifer match would do. The
same experiment may be performed with a needle,
and it must not be supposed that a very fine
needle or pin alone is suitable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Hit or Miss.</span></h3>

<p>Great amusement is excited by this game when
played in the presence of a company of guests.
Spread a sheet upon the floor and place two chairs
upon it. Seat two of the party in the chairs
within reach of each other and blindfold them.
Give each a saucer of cracker or bread crumbs and
a spoon, then request them to feed each other.
The frantic efforts of each victim to reach his fellow
sufferer’s mouth is truly absurd—the crumbs
finding lodgment in the hair, ears and neck much
oftener than the mouth. Sometimes bibs are
fastened around the necks of the victims for protection.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Going Shopping.</span></h3>

<p>A lively game of “talk and touch.” The company
is seated in a circle, and one who understands
the game commences by saying to his neighbor at
the right:</p>

<p>“I have been shopping.”</p>

<p>“What did you buy?” is the required response.</p>

<p>“A dress,” “a book,” “some flowers,” “a
pencil”—whatever the first speaker wishes, provided
always that he can, in pronouncing the
word, touch the object mentioned. Then the
second player addresses his neighbor in similar
manner, and so on around the circle until the
secret of the game is discovered by all.</p>

<p>Whoever mentions an object without touching
it, or names one that has already been given,
pays a forfeit.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Three Matches.</span></h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 448px;">
<img src="images/i_127.jpg" width="448" height="334" alt="matches stuck together being lifted" />
</div>

<p>With your penknife slit one end of a match,
and trim that of another into a wedge shape. Insert
this latter into the split end of the former, so
that the two shall form an acute angle. Place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
them on the table, the angle upward, and prop
them up by leaning another match against them,
the whole forming a tripod, as shown in the figure.
Now hand a fourth match to one of the company,
and request him to lift with it the other
three from the table. Such is the problem to be
resolved. All that you have to do is to insert the
fourth match just inside the point of the tripod,
between the two conjoined and the single match;
and with it to press the two joined matches lightly
outward till the third falls with its upper end on
the one you hold. You lower this till the end of
the single match passes within the angle formed
by the juncture of the two first. If you then raise
the match you hold in your hand, the three others
will ride astride upon it, the single match on the
one side, the two joined matches on the other. The
table used should have a cloth on it, that the lower
ends of the matches may not slip. Some little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
delicacy of handling is needful to make the single
match fall just in the right position, but this once
achieved, the three thus slightly supported might
be carried a mile without any fear of dropping
them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Spin a Cent Upon a Needle Point.</span></h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 248px;">
<img src="images/i_128.jpg" width="248" height="377" alt="very bent wire balanced" />
</div>

<p>Bend a hair-pin as shown in our illustration.
Place a cent horizontally on the right-hand hook,
which should be narrow enough to clip it closely,
and hang upon the left-hand hook a tolerably
heavy finger-ring (or two, if one is found insufficient).
Place the free edge of the coin on some
upright point (that of a lady’s bonnet-pin, for
example), and you will find that the combination
can be made to balance itself. Furthermore, by
gently blowing upon the ring, you can set the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
apparatus revolving rapidly, without any disturbance
to its equilibrium.</p>

<p>If you spin the cent upon a very sharp steel
needle, you will find that the needle will at length
work its way completely through the coin. You
may therefore, if you please, propound your puzzle
in this rather striking form—How to bore a
hole through a cent by merely blowing upon it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Counting Apple-seeds.</span></h3>

<p>This rhyme, formerly used in England, remains
unchanged, except the omission of the last three
lines. Apples were an essential part of every entertainment
in the country. The apple, having
been properly named for a person, with a pressure
of the finger, was divided, to decide the fate of
the person concerned according to its number of
seeds.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Spin the Plate.</span></h3>

<p>A tin pie-plate is set spinning in the middle of
the floor; someone is called from the party, who
must catch the plate before it stops, or pay a forfeit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lighting the Candle.</span></h3>

<p>This feat is a very amusing one and is performed
as follows: Two persons kneel on the ground, facing
each other. Each holds in his left hand a
candle in a candlestick, at the same time grasping
his right foot in his right hand. This position
compels him to balance himself on his left knee.
One of the candles is lighted; the other is not.
The holders are required to light the unlighted
candle from the lighted one. The conditions are
simple enough, but one would hardly believe how
often the performers will roll over on the floor
before they succeed in lighting the candle. It
will be found desirable to spread a newspaper on
the floor between the combatants. Many spots of
candle-grease will thus be intercepted, and the
peace of mind of the lady of the house proportionately
spared.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Problem in Gymnastics.</span></h3>

<p>Place a low stool on the floor, close against the
wall, and yourself facing the wall, with your feet
distant from it just double the width of the stool.
Stoop down and grasp the stool with one hand on
either side, and rest your head against the wall.
Now lift the stool from the floor, and slowly raise
yourself to the erect position—or rather, endeavor
to do so. It is better to try the experiment for
the first time on a well-carpeted floor. On
polished oak or parqueterie you would probably
have a bad fall. We have here a curious effect of
the displacement of the centre of gravity of the
body, which renders it almost impossible to stand
upright without first replacing the stool on the
ground, and resting the hand upon it to get the
needful support.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Redeeming Forfeits.</span></h3>

<p>The girl who is to name the penalty by which
the forfeit must be redeemed lays her face on the
lap of another who sits on a chair, while a third,
standing behind, holds the article over her head
and asks:</p>

<p>“Here is a forfeit, a very fine forfeit; what
shall be done to redeem it?”</p>

<p>“Is it fine or superfine?” (i. e., does it belong
to a gentleman or to a lady.)</p>

<p>The sentence is then declared.</p>

<p>Another formula, used in the Middle and
Southern States, is: “Heavy, heavy, what hangs
over you?”</p>

<p>The German usage is nearly the same, the question
being: “Judge, what is your sentence, what
shall he do whose pledge I have in my hand?”
Any proper penalty may be named.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Game of Location.</span></h3>

<p>Sides are chosen and the opposing parties stand
in separate lines as for a spelling match. No. 1
of one side mentions the name of some city or
town in any part of the globe, and No. 1 of the
other side must locate it before his opponent has
finished counting ten or twenty, as may be agreed.
He then, in turn, names a city which No. 2 on the
other side must locate. If anyone fails to give the
correct location before the expiration of the ten
counts, a member from the side he represents is
chosen by the other.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Game of Clumps.</span></h3>

<p>Sides are chosen, and a representative from each
side goes from the room. After choosing the object
to be guessed, they return, each going to his
<i>opponent’s</i> side, where he is asked questions to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
answered by “yes” or “no,” concerning the object
selected. The side which first guesses correctly
has the privilege of choosing a member from
the opposing side. Then the successful guesser of
one party and the player who has been most nearly
successful on the other go from the room and
choose a new subject. The two parties must be
separated by some distance and the questioning
carried on in a low voice, so that nothing said by
one side can be heard by the other. An illustration:</p>

<p>For instance, the object chosen is the thumb on
the right hand of the Washington Monument.</p>

<p>Question. “Does it belong to the animal kingdom?”</p>

<p>Answer. “No.”</p>

<p>Q. “To the mineral kingdom?”</p>

<p>A. “Yes.”</p>

<p>Q. “Is it in existence now?”</p>

<p>A. “Yes.”</p>

<p>Q. “Is it in this country?”</p>

<p>A. “Yes,” and so on until a successful termination
of the guessing is reached.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ant and Cricket.</span></h3>

<p>One of the company being appointed to represent
the <i>Cricket</i>, seats himself in the midst of the
other players, who are the <i>Ants</i>, and writes upon
a piece of paper the name of a certain grain, whatever
kind he pleases. He then addresses the first
<i>Ant</i>: “My dear neighbor, I am very hungry, and
have come to you for aid. What will you give
me?” “<i>A grain of rice</i>, <i>a kernel of corn</i>, <i>a worm</i>,”
etc., replies the Ant, as he sees fit. The Cricket
asks each in turn, and if one of them announces as
his gift the word already written upon the paper,
the Cricket declares himself satisfied and changes
places with the Ant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>If the desired word is not spoken, however, the
same cricket keeps his place, scorning each article
of food as it is suggested to him. In either case
the form of the question changes, and the supplicant
says: “My hunger is appeased and now I
wish to dance. What dance do you advise?” He
therefore writes the name of a dance upon his
paper and the Ants advise in turn—“<i>A polka</i>, <i>a
fandango</i>, <i>a minuet</i>,” etc. The third Cricket declares
himself unable to dance without music, and
requests that a suitable instrument be recommended.
“<i>A lyre</i>, <i>a kazoo</i>, <i>a mandolin</i>,” etc., say
the Ants.</p>

<p>The fourth Cricket, tired of dancing, wishes to
rest, and asks upon what he shall take his repose.
“<i>A rose-leaf</i>, <i>the moss</i>, <i>the heart of a lily</i>,” are all
suggested, but unless the name he has previously
written upon his paper is mentioned, he expresses
himself dissatisfied.</p>

<p>The fifth and last Cricket confesses fear lest
while sleeping he shall be devoured by a bird, but
requests advice concerning the choice of a destroyer.
“<i>A lark</i>, <i>a turtle-dove</i>, <i>a pigeon</i>,” are
thereupon mentioned by the Ants.</p>

<p>By carefully selecting the most uncommon
names for replies, the same Cricket may be kept
through the entire set of questions. If the word
written upon his paper, however, is mentioned in
any case, he must show it to the unfortunate Ant,
to whom he surrenders his place.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Gussing Characters.</span></h3>

<p>One of the party leaves the room while
the others decide upon some character, real or
fictitious. The absentee is then recalled, and each
in turn asks him a question referring to the character
he has been elected to represent. When he
guesses his identity the player whose question has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
thrown the most light upon the subject has to go
from the room.</p>

<p>For example: A goes from the room and the
company decides that he shall represent King
Henry VIII. When he enters, No. 1 asks:
“Which one of your wives did you love best?”
No. 2 says: “Do you approve of a man’s marrying
his deceased brother’s wife?” No. 3 adds:
“Were you very sorry your brother died?” etc.,
while A, after guessing various names, is led by
some question to guess correctly, and the fortunate
questioner is consequently sent from the room to
have a new character assigned him in turn.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Magic Candle Extinguisher.</span></h3>

<p>Cut out of thin cardboard a couple of little figures,
and insert in the mouth of each, fixing it,
say, with sealing-wax, a piece of quill (a portion of
a toothpick, for instance), through which he or she
appears to be blowing. Fill each tube with sand,
but leave a minute space empty at the end remote
from the figure. In the cavity of the one place a
few grains of gunpowder, and in the other a tiny
morsel of phosphorus. The figures being thus
privately prepared beforehand, you call for a
lighted candle, and announce that the one figure
will blow it out and the other relight it.</p>

<p>The moment the tube with the powder is brought
near the candle, the powder will ignite, and will
produce an explosion of infinitesimal proportions,
but large enough to blow out the candle and cause
a jet of smoke in the direction of the second figure,
which you hold in the opposite hand. The heat of
the smoke will cause the phosphorus to ignite, and
if you hold the tube which contains it pretty close
to the wick, the candle will again be lighted.</p>

<p>This is an experiment which should not be attempted
by unskilled hands. Both gunpowder and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
phosphorus require to be handled with great care,
but it might be possible to make, out of thin paper,
little cartridges containing a minute portion of
each substance, to be introduced into the tubes as
occasion required. Unless the reader has some
practical knowledge of laboratory work, he should
not attempt this experiment.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Broken Mirror.</span></h3>

<p>The painters have given the last finishing touches
to the room they have been redecorating, but before
leaving they cannot resist the temptation of a
joke on whoever is sent to see that all is in order.
Imagine the horror of the servant-girl when she
sees a great crack, perhaps half a dozen, right
across the big drawing-room mirror. Meanwhile,
behind her back the workmen are smiling over her
discomfiture. After having sufficiently chuckled
over the success of their innocent joke they offer
to repair the damage, and, not to keep their victim
longer in suspense, one of them takes a wet cloth
and passes it over the supposed crack in the glass.
Lo, a miracle! The cracks disappear under the
mere touch of the damp duster, and the glass is
whole again. She can hardly believe her own
eyes. And yet there is no witchcraft about the
matter. If you are inclined to play a similar trick,
you have only to trace, with a small piece of soap,
on the mirror which is to appear broken, a few fine
lines in imitation of cracks. Their reflection in
the glass will give them depth, and make them
seem as though they extended through the thickness
of the glass, while a rub with a wet flannel
will make all right again.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Parlor Zoetrope.</span></h3>

<p>We have here the game of the “little horses,”
so popular at Continental watering-places, brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
in a simplified and innocent form within reach of
everybody. Glue round the inside of the rim of a
circular dish of white porcelain, a number of little
cardboard figures of animals; or simply sketch
thereon, with ink, similar figures or numerals,
equidistant from one another. Place the dish thus
furnished, in an ordinary dish of somewhat larger
size, and having its centre slightly elevated—a not
uncommon pattern. You will only have to give a
slight impulse with the hand to the smaller plate
to set it spinning within the other. Should the
larger dish not be raised in the centre, you have
only to pour into it a little water, enough to make
the inner dish just float, and it will then revolve
with great freedom, the water practically destroying
all friction.</p>

<p>You can repeat the same figure, but with, say,
the arms in different positions, so that, when the
plate is set spinning, you may have depicted, in
due order, the successive positions of a man raising
and lowering his arms. Thus, for example, if the
first figure has his arms hanging down close by his
sides, the next will have them a little further from
the body; the third will have them extended horizontally;
the next following a little higher; and,
finally, the last will have them raised above his
head. Now peep, with one eye only, through a
little hole made with a pin in a visiting-card or
playing-card, and gaze at any given point of the
circle described by the figures. When the dish is
set in motion, you apparently see one figure only,
but such figure seems to move like a living being,
its arms appearing to take in succession the various
positions which are really those of the separate
figures. You may amuse yourself by thus arranging
several series of such figures, their positions
varied in proper succession, thus reproducing, at
merely nominal expense, the scientific toy known
as the Zoetrope or Praxinoscope.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Wonderful Pin.</span></h3>

<p>Take a piece of cord elastic, and through it thrust
a pin bent by twisting the ends of the elastic, held
vertically between the thumb and finger of each
hand, and then drawing the hands apart, so as to
stretch the cord, you can communicate to this latter
a movement so rapid that the revolutions of
the pin shall produce the shape of a glass cup.
The illusion will be the more complete if the
pin is itself brilliantly illuminated, while having
a dark background behind it, the operator
should be in a darkened room, and a single ray of
sunlight from without, should fall through a hole
in the shutters, upon the pin. With a little skill in
manipulation one can produce, using pins bent in
different ways, the semblance of the most diverse
objects—say, a cheese-dish, and aquarium, a bouquet-holder,
or a goblet.</p>

<p>Should the form of the pin tend, by reason of
centrifugal force, to make it assume a horizontal
position, this can be cured by securing one end of
it, by means of fine white silk, to the elastic. This
will usually be invisible when the pin is made to
revolve as above described, and, in any case, will
not affect the appearance of the figure.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Shadows on the Wall.</span></h3>

<p>The exhibitor, as well as the cardboard figures, is
placed behind the spectators, a position which has
many advantages. Place on the table a lighted
candle, and in front of it, at two or three feet distance,
attach to the wall a sheet of white paper to
form your “screen.” Between the light and the
screen interpose some opaque body, for example,
an atlas or other large book.</p>

<p>But under such conditions how are we to cast the
shadows on the screen? Simply by the use of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
mirror, placed at the side of the table. The reflection
of the mirror will appear on the wall as a
luminous space, oval or oblong as the case may be,
and if you have placed it at the proper angle with
reference to the screen, and move your cardboard
shapes about cleverly between the candle and the
mirror, you will forthwith see little fantastic figures
projected in shadow on the screen, while the uninitiated
spectator is wholly at a loss to discover how
you produce them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Rotation of the Globe.</span></h3>

<p>When you next chance to eat an egg for breakfast,
do not fail to try the following experiment.
It is one which always succeeds, and is productive
of much amusement to the company.</p>

<p>Moisten slightly with water the rim of your plate,
and in the centre paint with the yolk of the egg a
sun with golden rays. By the aid of this simple
apparatus you will be in a position to illustrate, so
clearly that a child can comprehend it, the double
movement of the earth, which revolves simultaneously
round the sun and on its own axis.</p>

<p>All that you have to do is to place the empty
half-shell of your egg on the rim of the plate, and
keeping this latter duly sloped, by a slight movement
of the wrist as may be needful, you will see
the egg-shell begin to revolve rapidly on its own
axis, at the same time traveling round the plate.
It is hardly necessary to remark that the egg-shell
will not travel uphill, and the plate must therefore
be gradually shifted round, as well as sloped, so
that the shell may always have an inch or two of
descending plane before it.</p>

<p>The slight cohesion caused by the water which
moistens the plate counteracts the centrifugal force,
and so prevents the egg-shell falling off the edge of
the plate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Through the Water Dry.</span></h3>

<p>Into a basin full of water, throw a coin, or ring,
or other suitable object, and announce that you
will take it out of the basin without wetting your
hand. All that is needed to effect this is to dust
the surface of the water with some form of powder
having no cohesion with water, and which, consequently,
water does not moisten. Powdered lycopodium,
to be procured of any chemist, has this
property.</p>

<p>Having sprinkled a little of this powder on the
surface of the liquid, plunge your hand boldly to
the bottom, pick up the ring, and show the company
that your hand is as dry as it was before the
operation. This comes of the fact that the lycopodium
has formed over your hand a regular glove, to
which the liquid cannot adhere any more than it can
to the plumage of the ducks, which we see plunge
and plunge again, and still come up dry as ever,
by reason of the oily matter secreted by their
feathers.</p>

<p>Those who may care to carry the experiment
further may try it with <i>hot</i> water, increasing the
temperature at each attempt, when they will find
that it is possible, with the aid of the lycopodium,
to lift an article out of a kettle of all but boiling
water. The sensation of heat is not destroyed, but
it causes no injury to the tissues—in other words,
no scald.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hanging Without a Cord.</span></h3>

<p>Soak a thread in strong salt and water; dry
thoroughly, and repeat this two or three times.
This must be done privately beforehand. When
you bring forward the thread thus prepared, the
spectators have no reason to suppose that it is other
than the ordinary article.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>Use this thread to suspend a ring, choosing as
light a one as possible. Set fire to the thread,
which will burn from end to end, but the spectators
will be surprised to see that the ring does not fall,
being supported by the ash resulting from the combustion.
In reality, the fibrous particles of the
thread have been destroyed, but there remains a
tiny filament of salt, strong enough, if there is no
draught in the room, to support the weight of the
ring.</p>

<p>This experiment may be varied in this manner:</p>

<p>Attach four pieces of thread to the four corners
of a little piece of muslin, so as to form a miniature
hammock. Soak the whole in salt water; then
dry it, and repeat the operation three or four times.
When the threads and the muslin are thoroughly
saturated with salt and perfectly dry, place a blown
egg in the little hammock, suspended as shown in
the figure. Set fire to the hammock, which will
burn freely enough, as also the fine threads, but if
the experiment has been properly carried out, the
egg will remain suspended, to the astonishment of
all who behold it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Magic Scorpion.</span></h3>

<p>Place on the surface of the water in a glass or
basin a number of small pieces of camphor of various
sizes, together representing the form of some
animal, say a scorpion. After a little while the
scorpion will begin to stir in the water; you
will see him move his claws, as though trying to
swim, and curl his tail convulsively, as if in pain.</p>

<p>This amusing experiment is easy to perform, and
costs practically nothing, for camphor is to be
found in every household; but in spite of its simplicity
we may deduce from it, as you will see,
several interesting observations.</p>

<p>1. Our scorpion floats on the water, but lies
almost entirely below the surface. This proves to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
us that the specific gravity of camphor is nearly,
but not quite, equal to that of water.</p>

<p>2. The animal does not dissolve. Camphor is
therefore insoluble in water.</p>

<p>3. The different fragments of which our scorpion
consists do not separate, but remain one against
the other as we originally placed them. This is
because they are held together by the force known
as cohesion.</p>

<p>4. Lastly, the eccentric movements we have
mentioned depend on a well-ascertained but
mysterious property of camphor, viz., that when
placed on the surface of the water, it moves spontaneously.
It is a well-known fact that a morsel
of camphor placed in a glass of water will, after a
few moments, begin to move either with a sidelong
or rotary movement; such movement being due,
according to some authorities, to the recoil produced
by an escape of liberated gases; according
to others, to a mysterious force inherent in the
surface of liquids, and known as <i>superficial tension</i>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Amusing the Children.</span></h3>

<p>A clever way to amuse a party of children is to
invite them to a peanut party. Tiny cards of invitation
are sent out, on each of which two half
peanut shells are fastened. A large quantity of the
nuts are hidden about the house, and when the
young folks arrive they are told to hunt them.
They who find the most and least of them receive
prizes.</p>

<p>Another is a soap bubble party. The invitations
for this should have a pen and ink sketch of a pipe
and bubble. Provide plenty of clay pipes, with the
name of a guest written on each, and make the
soapsuds with the addition of glycerine to make
the bubbles strong and tough. For the prizes for
the most successful bubble blower, a fancy pipe is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
suitable. It can be made by gilding the handle and
outside of the bowl of a clay pipe and painting the
inside of the bowl in water colors. A bow of baby
ribbon to match the paint improves it. For the
booby prize a little pipe can be made from a match
and half an acorn shell.</p>

<p>A penny party furnishes amusement for an evening.
With the invitations is sent a request for each
guest to bring a penny, not for an admission fee,
but for use. For each guest there are provided two
cards and a pencil; one card is blank; the other
has a list of the things to be found on a penny.
The list is numbered, and each person is expected
to name as many as he can, prizes being awarded
for the best and poorest list. Find—1. Top of hill.
2. Place of worship. 3. An animal. 4. A fruit.
5. A common fruit. 6. Links between absent
friends. 7. Union of youth and old age. 8. A
vegetable. 9. Flowers. 10. What we fight for.
11. A metal. 12. A messenger. 13. A weapon of
defence. 14. A weapon of warfare. 15. A body of
water. 16. A beverage. 17. What young ladies
want. 18. The most popular State. 19. What men
work for. 20. Sign of royalty. 21. A jolly dog.
The answers are—1. Brow. 2. Temple. 3. Hare
(hair). 4. Date. 5. Apple. 6. Letters. 7. 1894
(the date of the penny). 8. Ear. 9. Tulips (two lips).
10. Liberty. 11. Copper. 12. One sent (cent). 13.
Shield. 14. Arrow. 15. Sea (c). 16. Tea (t). 17.
Beau (bow). 18. United States (matrimony). 19.
Money. 20. Crown. 21. A merry cur (America).
Usually a half hour is allowed for filling out the
blank cards, and after that some time for correcting
the lists and awarding prizes.</p>

<p>It is often hard to find games for evening amusements
that will amuse all. Some are so noisy that
the sensitive cannot enjoy them, but the following
will instruct as well as amuse: One is to transpose
the misplaced letters of words, usually the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
of a city. To prepare for the game make a large
quantity of small cards from pasteboards, about an
inch and a half square. Paste a large letter on
each one, cut from a newspaper or advertisement,
having several for each letter of the alphabet.
Give to each the letters necessary to spell a word
and let him study it out. Thus the letters <em class="gesperrt">ilisyantp</em>
can be made to spell Ypsilanti, or <em class="gesperrt">stoonb</em>
Boston.</p>

<p>Another game which is quite entertaining is
called a pronunciation match. Any number can
play. One is elected as leader. At first he will call
out a letter, as a, and each person must think
quickly while he counts five, and be ready to tell
the name of a city in the State agreed upon before
the contest begins. For instance, the leader, while
he counts five, points to one of the company who
must give the name of a city beginning with the
letter A, B or C, as the leader may announce.
When one answer has been given, he quickly
counts again, and points to another person until
some one fails to respond, when he is declared
leader and also pays a forfeit. It is very amusing
and teaches people to think quickly and keep their
wits about them.</p>

<h2>GAMES OF ARITHMETIC.</h2>

<h3>HOW TO TELL ANY NUMBER THOUGHT OF.</h3>


<p>Ask any person to think of a number, say a certain
number of dollars; tell him to borrow that
sum of some one in the company, and add the
number borrowed to the amount thought of. It
will here be proper to name the person who lends
him the money, and to beg the one who makes
the calculation to do it with great care, as he may
readily fall into an error, especially the first time.
Then say to the person: “I do not lend you, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
give you $10; add them to the former sum.” Continue
in this manner: “Give the half to the poor,
and retain in your memory the other half.” Then
add: “Return to the gentleman, or lady, what you
borrowed, and remember that the sum lent you
was exactly equal to the number thought of.” Ask
the person if he knows exactly what remains; he
will answer “Yes.” You must then say: “And I
know also the number that remains; it is equal to
what I am going to conceal in my hand.” Put
into one of your hands 5 pieces of money, and desire
the person to tell how many you have got.
He will answer 5; upon which open your hand
and show him the 5 pieces. You may then say:
“I well knew that your result was 5; but if you
had thought of a very large number, for example,
two or three millions, the result would have been
much greater, but my hand would not have held a
number of pieces equal to the remainder.” The
person then supposing that the result of the calculation
must be different, according to the difference
of the number thought of, will imagine that
it is necessary to know the last number in order to
guess the result; but this idea is false, for, in the
case which we have here supposed, whatever be
the number thought of, the remainder must always
be 5. The reason of this is as follows: The sum,
the half of which is given to the poor, is nothing
else than twice the number thought of, plus 10;
and when the poor have received their part, there
remains only the number thought of, plus 5; but
the number thought of is cut off when the sum
borrowed is returned, and, consequently, there remain
only 5. The result may be easily known,
since it will be the half of the number given in the
third part of the operation; for example, whatever
be the number thought of, the remainder will be
36 or 25 according as 72 or 50 have been given. If
this trick be performed several times successively,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
the number given in the third part of the operation
must be always different; for if the result were
several times the same, the deception might be discovered.
When the five first parts of the calculation
for obtaining a result are finished, it will be best
not to name it at first, but to continue the operation,
to render it more complex, by saying, for example:
“Double the remainder, deduct two, add
three, take the fourth part,” etc.; and the different
steps of the calculation may be kept in mind, in
order to know how much the first result has been
increased or diminished. This irregular process
never fails to confound those who attempt to
follow it.</p>


<h3>ANOTHER WAY.</h3>

<p>Tell the person to take 1 from the number
thought of, and then double the remainder; desire
him to take 1 from this double, and to add to it the
number thought of; in the last place, ask him the
number arising from this addition, and, if you add
3 to it, the third of the sum will be the number
thought of. The application of this rule is so easy
that it is needless to illustrate it by an example.</p>


<h3>A THIRD WAY.</h3>

<p>Ask the person to add 1 to the triple of the number
thought of, and to multiply the sum by three;
then bid him add to this product the number
thought of, and the result will be a sum from
which if 3 be subtracted, the remainder will be ten
times of the number required; and if the cipher on
the right be cut off from the remainder, the other
figure will indicate the number sought.</p>

<p>Example—Let the number thought of be 6, the
triple of which is 18; and if 1 be added, it makes
19; the triple of this last number is 57, and if 6 be
added it makes 63, from which if 3 be subtracted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the remainder will be 60; now, if the cipher on the
right be cut off, the remaining figure, 6, will be
the number required.</p>


<h3>A FOURTH WAY.</h3>

<p>Tell the person to multiply the number thought
of by itself; then desire him to add 1 to the number
thought of, and to multiply it also by itself; in
the last place, ask him to tell the difference of
these two products, which will certainly be an odd
number, and the least half of it will be the number
required.</p>

<p>Let the number thought of, for example, be 10;
which, multiplied by itself, gives 100; in the next
place, 10 increased by 1 is 11, which, multiplied by
itself, makes 121; and the difference of these two
squares is 21, the least half of which, being 10, is
the number thought of.</p>

<p>This operation might be varied by desiring the
person to multiply the second number by itself,
after it has been diminished by 1. In this case, the
number thought of will be equal to the greater
half of the difference of the two squares.</p>

<p>Thus, in the preceding example, the square of
the number thought of is 100, and that of the same
number, less 1, is 81; the difference of these is 19,
the greater half of which, or 10, is the number
thought of.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">How to Tell Numbers Thought of.</span></h3>

<p>If one or more numbers thought of be greater
than 9, we must distinguish two cases; that in
which the number of the numbers thought of is
odd, and that in which it is even. In the first case,
ask the sum of the first and second; of the second
and third; the third and fourth; and so on to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
last; and then the sum of the first and the last.
Having written down all these sums in order, add
together all those, the places of which are odd, as
the first, the third, the fifth, etc.; make another
sum of all those, the places of which are even, as
the second, the fourth, the sixth, etc.; subtract
this sum from the former, and the remainder will
be the double of the first number. Let us suppose,
for example, that the five following numbers are
thought of, 3, 7, 13, 17, 20, which when added two
and two as above, give 10, 20, 30, 37, 23: the sum
of the first, third, and fifth is 63, and that of the
second and fourth is 57; if 57 be subtracted from
63, the remainder, 6, will be the double of the first
number, 3. Now, if 3 be taken from 10, the first
of the sums, the remainder, 7, will be the second
number; and by proceeding in this manner, we
may find all the rest.</p>

<p>In the second case, that is to say, if the number
of the numbers thought of be even, you must ask
and write down, as above, the sum of the first and
the second; that of the second and third; and so on,
as before; but instead of the sum of the first and
the last, you must take that of the second and last;
then add together those which stand in the even
places, and form them into a new sum apart; add
also those in the odd places, the first excepted, and
subtract this sum from the former, the remainder
will be the double of the second number; and if
the second number, thus found, be subtracted from
the sum of the first and second, you will have the
first number; if it be taken from that of the second
and third, it will give the third; and so of the rest.
Let the numbers thought of be, for example, 3, 7,
13, 17: the sums formed as above are 10, 20, 30, 24;
the sum of the second and fourth is 44, from which
if 30, the third, be subtracted, the remainder will
be 14, the double of 7, the second number. The
first, therefore, is 3, third 13, and the fourth 17.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>When each of the numbers thought of does not
exceed 9, they may be easily found in the following
manner:</p>

<p>Having made the person add 1 to the double of
the first number thought of, desire him to multiply
the whole by 5, and to add to the product the
second number. If there be a third, make him
double this first sum, and add 1 to it, after which,
desire him to multiply the new sum by 5, and to
add to it the third number. If there be a fourth,
proceed in the same manner, desiring him to double
the preceding sum; to add to it 1; to multiply
by 5; to add the fourth number; and so on.</p>

<p>Then, ask the number arising from the addition
of the last number thought of, and if there were
two numbers, subtract 5 from it; if there were
three, 55; if there were four, 555; and so on; for
the remainder will be composed of figures, of which
the first on the left will be the first number thought
of, the next the second, and so on.</p>

<p>Suppose the number thought of to be 3, 4, 6; by
adding 1 to 6, the double of the first, we shall have
7, which, being multiplied by 5, will give 35; if 4,
the second number thought of, be then added, we
shall have 39, which doubled, gives 78; and, if we
add 1, and multiply 79, the sum, by 5, the result
will be 395. In the last place, if we add 6, the
number thought of, the sum will be 401; and if 55
be deducted from it, we shall have, for remainder,
346, the figures of which, 3, 4, 6, indicate in order
the three numbers thought of.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Gold and Silver Game.</span></h3>

<p>One of the party having in one hand a piece of
gold, and in the other a piece of silver, you may
tell in which hand he has the gold, and in which
the silver, by the following method: Some value,
represented by an even number, such as 8, must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
be assigned to the gold, and a value represented
by an odd number, such as 3, must be assigned to
the silver; after which, desire the person to multiply
the number in the right hand by any even
number whatever, such as 2; and that in the left
by an odd number, as 3; then bid him add together
the two products, and if the whole sum be odd,
the gold will be in the right hand, and the silver
in the left; if the sum be even, the contrary will
be the case.</p>

<p>To conceal the trick better, it will be sufficient
to ask whether the sum of the two products can
be halved without a remainder; for in that case
the total will be even, and in the contrary case
odd.</p>

<p>It may be readily seen, that the pieces, instead
of being in the two hands of the same person, may
be supposed to be in the hands of two persons, one
of whom has the even number, or piece of gold,
and the other the odd number, or piece of silver.
The same operations may then be performed in
regard to these two persons, as are performed in
regard to the two hands of the same person, calling
the one privately the right and the other the left.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Number Bag.</span></h3>

<p>The plan is to let a person select several numbers
out of a bag, and to tell him the number which shall
exactly divide the sum of those he has chosen:
Provide a small bag, divided into two parts, into
one of which put several tickets, numbered 6, 9,
15, 36, 63, 120, 213, 309, etc.; and in the other part
put as many other tickets, marked No. 3 only.
Draw a handful of tickets from the first part, and,
after showing them to the company, put them into
the bag again, and, having opened it a second time,
desire any one to take out as many tickets as he
thinks proper; when he has done that, you open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
privately the other part of the bag, and tell him to
take out of it one ticket only. You may safely pronounce
that the ticket shall contain the number by
which the amount of the other numbers is divisible;
for, as each of these numbers can be multiplied by
3, their sum total must, evidently, be divisible by
that number. An ingenious mind may easily diversify
this exercise, by marking the tickets in one
part of the bag, with any numbers that are divisible
by 9 only, the properties of both 9 and 3 being the
same; and it should never be exhibited to the
same company twice without being varied.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Mystical Number Nine.</span></h3>

<p>The discovery of remarkable properties of the
number 9 was accidentally made, more than forty
years since, though, we believe, it is not generally
known:</p>

<p>The component figures of the product made by
the multiplication of every digit into the number
9, when added together, make <small>NINE</small>.</p>

<p>The order of these component figures is reversed,
after the said number has been multiplied by 5.</p>

<p>The component figures of the amount of the
multipliers (<i>viz.</i> 45), when added together, make
<small>NINE</small>.</p>

<p>The amount of the several products, or multiples
of 9 (<i>viz.</i> 405), when divided by 9, gives, for a
quotient, 45; that is, 4+5=<small>NINE</small>.</p>

<p>The amount of the first product (<i>viz.</i> 9), when
added to the other product, whose respective component
figures make 9, is 81; which is the square
of <small>NINE</small>.</p>

<p>The said number 81, when added to the above-mentioned
amount of the several products, or
multiples of 9 (<i>viz.</i> 405) makes 486; which, if
divided by 9, gives, for a quotient, 54: that is,
5+4=<small>NINE</small>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>It is also observable, that the number of changes
that may be rung on nine bells, is 362,880; which
figures, added together, make 27; that is, 2+7=<small>NINE</small>.</p>

<p>And the quotient of 362,880, divided by 9, will
be, 40,320; that is 4+0+3+2+0=<small>NINE</small>.</p>

<p>To add a figure to any given number, which
shall render it divisible by Nine: Add the figures
together in your mind, which compose the number
named; and the figure which must be added to the
sum produced, in order to render it divisible by 9,
is the one required. Thus</p>

<p>Suppose the given number to be 7521:</p>

<p>Add those together, and 15 will be produced;
now 15 requires 3 to render it divisible by 9; and
that number, 3, being added to 7521, causes the
same divisibility: 7521 plus 3 gives 7524, and,
divided by 9, gives 836.</p>

<p>This exercise may be diversified by your specifying,
before the sum is named, the particular place
where the figure shall be inserted, to make the
number divisible by 9; for it is exactly the same
thing, whether the figure be put at the head of the
number, or between any two of its digits.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Magic Hundred.</span></h3>

<p>Two persons agree to take, alternately, numbers
less than a given number, for example, 11, and to
add them together till one of them has reached a
certain sum, such as 100. By what means can one
of them infallibly attain to that number before the
other? The whole secret in this, consists in immediately
making choice of the numbers, 1, 12, 23,
34, and so on, or of a series which continually increases
by 11, up to 100. Let us suppose, that the
first person, who knows the game, makes choice
of 1; it is evident that his adversary, as he must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
count less than 11, can, at most, reach 11, by
adding 10 to it. The first will then take 1, which
will make 12; and whatever number the second
may add, the first will certainly win, provided he
continually add the number which forms the complement
of that of his adversary, to 11; that is to
say, if the latter take 8, he must take 3; if 9, he
must take 2; and so on. By following this method,
he will infallibly attain to 89; and it will then be
impossible for the second to prevent him from
getting first to 100; for whatever number the
second takes, he can attain only to 99; after which
the first may say—“and 1 makes 100.” If the
second take 1 after 89, it would make 90, and his
adversary would finish by saying—“and 10 make
100.” Between two persons who are equally acquainted
with the game, he who begins must necessarily
win.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Guess The Missing Figure.</span></h3>

<p>To tell the figure a person has struck out of the
sum of two given numbers:—Arbitrarily command
those numbers only, that are divisible by 9; such,
for instance, as 36, 63, 81, 117, 126, 162, 261, 360,
315, and 432. Then let a person choose any two of
these numbers; and, after adding them together in
his mind, strike out from the sum any one of the
figures he pleases. After he has so done, desire
him to tell you the sum of the remaining figures;
and it follows, that the number which you are
obliged to add to this amount, in order to make it
9 or 18, is the one he struck out. Thus:—Suppose
he chooses the numbers 162 and 261, making altogether
423, and that he strike out the centre figure,
the two other figures will, added together, make 7,
which, to make 9, requires 2, the number struck
out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The King and the Counselor.</span></h3>

<p>A King being desirous to confer a liberal reward
on one of his courtiers, who had performed some
very important service, desired him to ask whatever
he thought proper, assuring him it should be
granted. The courtier, who was well acquainted
with the science of numbers, only requested that
the monarch would give him a quantity of wheat
equal to that which would arise from one grain
doubled sixty-three times successively. The value
of the reward was immense; for it will be seen, by
calculation, that the sixty-fourth term of the double
progression divided by 1: 2: 4: 8: 16: 32: etc.,
is 9223372036854775808. But the sum of all the
terms of a double progression, beginning with 1,
may be obtained by doubling the last term, and
subtracting from it 1. The number of the grains
of wheat, therefore, in the present case, will be
18446744073709551615. Now, if a pint contains 9216
grains of wheat, a gallon will contain 73728; and,
as eight gallons make one bushel, if we divide the
above result by eight times 73728, we shall have
31274997411295 for the number of the bushels of
wheat equal to the above number of grains: a
quantity greater than what the whole earth could
produce in several years.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Nails in the Horse’s Shoe.</span></h3>

<p>A man took a fancy to a horse, which a dealer
wished to dispose of at as high a price as he could;
the latter, to induce the man to become a purchaser,
offered to let him have the horse for the
value of the twenty-fourth nail in his shoes, reckoning
one farthing for the first nail, two for the
second, four for the third, and so on to the twenty-fourth.
The man, thinking he should have a good
bargain, accepted the offer; the price of the horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
was, therefore, necessarily great. By calculating
as before, the twenty-fourth term of the progression
1 : 2 : 4 : 8: etc., will be found to be 8388608,
equal to the number of farthings the purchaser
gave for the horse; the price, therefore amounted
to £8738. 2s. 8d.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Dinner Party Puzzle.</span></h3>

<p>A club of seven agreed to dine together every
day successively as long as they could sit down to
table in different order. How many dinners would
be necessary for that purpose? It may be easily
found, by the rules already given, that the club
must dine together 5040 times, before they would
exhaust all the arrangements possible, which
would require about thirteen years.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Basket and Stones.</span></h3>

<p>If a hundred stones be placed in a straight line,
at the distance of a yard from each other, the first
being at the same distance from a basket, how
many yards must the person walk who engages to
pick them up, one by one, and put them into the
basket? It is evident that, to pick up the first
stone, and put it into the basket, the person must
walk two yards; for the second, he must walk
four; for the third, six; and so on, increasing by
two, to the hundredth. The number of yards which
the person must walk, will be equal to the sum of
the progression, 2, 4, 6, etc., the last term of which
is 200, (22). But the sum of the progression is equal
to 202, the sum of the two extremes, multiplied by
50, or half the number of terms: that is to say,
10,100 yards, which makes more than 5½ miles.</p>

<h2>LIVING PICTURES.</h2>


<p>There are few better amusements for a large
party in the same house, with plenty of time on
their hands, than the organization of <i>Tableaux
vivants</i>. Tableaux, to be successfully represented,
demand quite as much attention to detail, and
scarcely less careful rehearsal, than a theatrical
performance. The first element of success is a
competent stage manager. His artistic taste should
be beyond all question, and his will should be law
among the members of his corps. The essentials
of a “living picture” are very much the same as
those of a picture of the inanimate description,
viz., form, color, and arrangement. If, therefore,
you can secure for the office of stage manager a
gentleman of some artistic skill, by all means do
so, as his technical knowledge will be found of the
greatest possible service.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to plan your series of pictures,
it will be necessary to provide the “frame” in
which they are to be exhibited. If the room which
you propose to use has folding-doors, they will of
course be used. A curtain, preferably of some dark
color, should be hung on each side, and a lambrequin,
or valance, across the top. Where circumstances
admit, the directions we give elsewhere as
to the construction of a stage and proscenium for
private theatricals, may be followed with advantage.
In any case, a piece of fine gauze should be
carefully stretched over the whole length and
depth of the opening. This is found, by producing
softer outlines, materially to enhance the pictorial
effect. If it is practicable to have a raised stage, it
will be found a great addition. Where this cannot
be arranged, it is well to place a board, six inches
in width, and covered with the same material as the
rest of the frame, across the floor (on edge) from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
side to side, in the position which the footlights
would ordinarily occupy.</p>

<p>The next consideration will be the curtain. The
ordinary domestic curtains, hung by rings from a
rod or pole, and opening in the middle, will serve
as a makeshift; but where a really artistic series
of tableaux is contemplated, the regular stage-curtain
of green baize is decidedly to be preferred.</p>

<p>The question of “background” will be the next
point to be attended to. <i>Tableaux vivants</i> may
be divided into two classes, the <i>dramatic</i>, <i>i. e.</i>, representing
some incident, <i>e. g.</i>, a duel, or a trial in a
court of justice; and the simply <i>artistic</i>, viz., such
as portray merely a group, allegorical or otherwise,
without reference to any particular plot or
story. For the former, an appropriate scene is required,
varying with each tableau represented; for
the latter, all that is necessary is a simple background
of drapery, of such a tone of color as to
harmonize with, and yet to give full prominence to,
the group of actors. The material of the latter, as
also the covering of the floor, should be of woolen
or velvet, so as to absorb rather than reflect light.
A lustrous background, as of satin or glazed calico,
will completely destroy the effect of an otherwise
effective <i>tableau</i>.</p>

<p>The lighting is a point of very considerable importance—the
conditions appropriate to an ordinary
theatrical performance being here reversed.
In an ordinary dramatic performance all shadow is
a thing to be avoided, the point aimed at being to
secure a strong bright light, uniformly distributed
over the stage. In a <i>tableau vivant</i>, on the contrary,
the skilful manipulation of light and shade
is a valuable aid in producing artistic effect. Footlights
should, in this case, either be dispensed
with altogether, or at any rate used very sparingly,
the stronger light coming from one or the other
side. A good deal of experiment, and some little
artistic taste, will be necessary to attain the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
balance in this particular. Where gas is available,
it will afford the readiest means of illumination.
What is called “string-light,” viz., a piece of
gaspipe with fishtail burners at frequent intervals,
connected with the permanent gas arrangements
of the house by a piece of india-rubber tube, and
fixed in a vertical position behind each side of the
temporary proscenium, will be found very effective;
one or the other set of lights being turned up
as may be necessary. Where a green or red light
is desired, the interposition of a strip of glass of
that color, or of a “medium” of red or green silk
or tammy, will give the necessary tone. Colored
fires are supplied for the same purpose, but are
subject to the drawback of being somewhat odoriferous
in combustion. Where, as is sometimes the
case, a strong white light is required, this may be
produced by burning the end of a piece of magnesium
wire in the flame of an ordinary candle.</p>

<p>These points being disposed of, costume and
make-up will be the next consideration. As to the
latter, the reader will find full instructions in the
chapter devoted to private theatricals. With respect
to costume, as the characters are only seen
for a few moments, and in one position, this point
may be dealt with in a much more rough-and-ready
manner than would be advisable in the case
of a regular dramatic performance. The royal
crown need only be golden—the royal robe need
only be trimmed with ermine—on the side toward
the spectators; indeed, the proudest of sovereigns,
from the audience point of view, may, as seen from
the rear, be the humblest of citizens. Even on the
side toward the spectators a great deal of “make-believe”
is admissible. Seen through the intervening
gauze, the cheapest cotton velvet is equal
to the richest silk; glazed calico takes the place of
satin; and even the royal ermine may be admirably
simulated by tails of black worsted stitched on
a ground of flannel. Laces may be manufactured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
from cut paper, and a dollar’s worth of tinsel will
afford jewels for a congress of sovereigns. Of
course, there is not the least objection to his wearing
a crown of the purest gold, or diamonds of the
finest possible water (if he can get them), but they
will not look one whit more effective than the
homely substitutes we have mentioned.</p>

<p>A “ghost effect” may, where necessary, be produced
by the aid of a magic lantern; the other
lights of the tableau being lowered in order to give
sufficient distinctness to the reflection.</p>

<p>Dramatic tableaux may often be exhibited with
advantage in two or more “scenes;” the curtain
being lowered for a moment in order to enable the
characters to assume a fresh position. Examples
of this will be found among the tableaux which
follow.</p>

<p>Having indicated the general arrangements of
<i>tableaux vivants</i>, we append, for the reader’s
assistance, a selection of effective subjects, both
simply pictorial, and dramatic.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">i. Dignity and Impudence.</span></h3>

<p class="center">(<i>With background of plain drapery, remaining
unchanged.</i>)</p>

<p>A magnificent flunkey, in a gorgeous suit of
livery, standing (with left hand on hip, right hand
in breast), side by side with a very small and saucy
“boy in buttons,” upon whom he looks down
superciliously. Boy with both hands in trouser-pockets,
and gazing up at his companion with an
expression of impertinent familiarity.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">ii. The Fortune-Teller.</span></h3>

<p>A pretty girl, in simple outdoor costume, standing
sideways to the spectators, with downcast eyes,
and a half-smiling, half-frightened expression. The
fortune-teller faces her, and holds the young lady’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
right hand in her left, while her own right holds a
coin with which she is apparently tracing the lines
of the young lady’s palm, at the same time gazing
with an arch expression into her face, as though to
note the effect of her predictions. The fortune-teller
should be in gipsy costume, a short, dark
skirt, and a hood of some brighter material thrown
carelessly over her head. She should be of a
swarthy complexion, with a good deal of color,
and jet-black hair.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">iii. Faith.</span></h3>

<p>A large cross, apparently of white marble (really
of deal, well washed with whitening and size)
occupies a diagonal position across the centre of
the stage, facing slightly towards the left. Its
base or plinth is formed of two or three successive
platforms or steps of the same material. At the
foot a woman kneels, clasping her arms around the
cross, as though she had just thrown herself into
that position in escaping from some danger. Her
gaze should be directed upwards. A loose brown
robe and hood, the latter thrown back off the head,
will be the most appropriate costume. Magnesium
light from above.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">iv. Hope.</span></h3>

<p>A female figure, clothed in sober gray, and seated
on a very low stool, facing <small>R.</small>, and gazing heavenwards.
(If a “sky” background is procurable, a
single star should be visible, and should be the
object of her gaze.) Her right elbow rests upon
her right knee, and her right hand supports her
chin. Her left hand hangs by her side, and at her
feet lies the emblematic anchor. Red light, not
too strong.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">v. Charity.</span></h3>

<p>A ragged boy, barefooted, and clasping a worn-out
broom, sits huddled on the ground <small>L.</small>, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
facing <small>R.</small> His arms are folded and rest on his knees,
and his head is bent down upon them, so as to hide
his face. A girl, in nun’s costume, is touching
him on the shoulder, and apparently proffering
help and sympathy.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">vi. Single Life.</span></h3>

<p>Scene, a tolerably well-furnished but untidy
sitting-room, with numerous traces of bachelor
occupation, such as crossed foils on the wall, a set
of boxing-gloves under a side-table; boots, hats,
and walking-sticks lying about in various directions.
On one corner of the table some one has
apparently breakfasted in rather higgledy-piggledy
fashion. Near the table sits a young man, with a
short pipe in his mouth, and one foot bare, while
he is endeavoring to darn an extremely dilapidated
sock.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">vii. The Sailor’s Farewell.</span></h3>

<p>Scene, a cottage home. A young man, in sailor
costume, and with a bundle on his shoulder, stands
with his right hand on the latch of the door, <small>R.C.</small>,
but looking back with a sorrowful expression at
his wife (personated by a young lady in short black
or blue skirt, red or white blouse, and white mob-cap),
who sits with her apron up to her eyes in an
apparent agony of grief. Three children are
present, the two elder crying for sympathy, the
youngest sitting in a crib or cradle, and amusing
himself with some toy, in apparent unconsciousness
of his father’s approaching departure. Soft blue
light from <small>L.</small> Music, “The Minstrel Boy.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">viii. Home Again.</span></h3>

<p>The same scene. Children a couple of years
older. (This may be effected by suppressing the
youngest, and introducing a fresh eldest, as much
like the others as possible.) The sailor of the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
scene, slightly more tanned, and with a fuller,
“made-up” beard, has apparently just entered.
The wife has both arms round his neck, her face
being hidden in his bosom. Of the children, the
eldest has seized and is kissing her father’s hand,
while the two younger each cling round one leg.
Soft red light. Music, “A Lass that Loves a
Sailor,” or “When Johnny comes Marching Home
Again.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Various Tableaux.</span></h3>

<p>We have not space to give the complete <i>mise
en scène</i> of a larger number of tableaux, but
subjoin a list of favorite subjects, leaving their
actual arrangement to the taste and intelligence of
the reader. It will usually be safe to follow the
hints in good illustrations.</p>

<p>“Choosing the Wedding Gown.” A charming
scene, after Mulready, from the “Vicar of Wakefield.”</p>

<p>“William Penn Signing the Treaty with the Indians.”</p>

<p>“Scene from ‘Pickwick.’” Mr. Pickwick, with
Mrs. Bardell in his arms, surprised by his four
friends, whose countenances are just visible in the
open door-way. See illustrations to “Pickwick
Papers.”</p>

<p>“The Drunkard’s Home,” “Signing the
Pledge.” “The Temperance Home.” See some
good illustrations.</p>

<p>“Mary Queen of Scots and the Four Maries.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Pecksniff Dismissing Tom Pinch.”</p>

<p>“The Song of the Shirt.”</p>

<p>“Little Red Riding-Hood.”</p>

<p>“The Duel from the ‘Corsican Brothers.’”</p>

<p>“Héloïse in her Cell.”</p>

<p>“William Tell Shooting the Apple from his
Son’s Head.”</p>

<p>Etc., etc., etc.</p>

<h2>THE WAXWORKS GALLERY.</h2>


<p>This capital form of amusement has attained
great and deserved popularity. It shares with
Living Pictures the merit of giving employment to
several performers at once, and has the special advantage
of being far more easily organized. The
idea is that of a Waxwork Exhibition, the characters
being personated, after a burlesque fashion,
by living performers. Each “figure” is first duly
described by the exhibitor, and then “wound up,”
and made to go through certain characteristic
movements.</p>

<p>The collection is supposed to be that of the far-famed
Mrs. Jarley, of “Old Curiosity Shop”
celebrity. She may be assisted, if thought desirable,
by “Little Nell,” and a couple of man-servants,
John and Peter. The costume of Mrs.
Jarley is a black or chintz dress, bright shawl, and
huge bonnet; that of Little Nell may be a calico
dress, and white apron, with hat slung over her
arm. John and Peter may be dressed in livery
suits, and should be provided with a watchman’s
rattle, screw-driver, hammer, nails, and oil-can.
At the rise of the curtain the figures are seen
ranged in a semicircle at the back of the stage, and
Little Nell is discovered dusting them with a long
feather brush. Mrs. Jarley stands in front, and
delivers her descriptive orations, directing her men
to bring forward each figure before she describes
it. After having been duly described, the figure is
“wound” up, and goes through its peculiar movement,
and when it stops it is moved back to its place.</p>

<p>If the stage is small, or it is desired that the
same actors shall appear in various characters in
succession, the figures may be exhibited in successive
groups or compartments, the curtain being
lowered to permit one party to retire, and another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
to take their places. After the whole of the figures
of a given chamber have been described,
the assistants wind them all up, and they go
through their various movements simultaneously,
to a pianoforte accompaniment, which should
gradually grow faster, coming at last to a sudden
stop, when the figures become motionless, and the
curtain falls.</p>

<p>If it is found impracticable to procure a lady to
deliver the descriptions effectively, Mrs. Jarley
may be made a silent character, sitting on one
side, and occasionally making believe to dust or
arrange a figure, while the “patter” is delivered
by a male exhibitor. Or Mrs. Jarley may, if preferred,
be suppressed altogether, and the exhibitor
appear as (say) Artemus Ward, or in ordinary
evening costume, without assuming any special
character. A good deal of fun may be made of the
supposed tendency of any particular figure to tip
over, and the application, by John and Peter, of
wooden wedges, penny pieces, etc., under its feet
to keep it upright. Supposed defective working,
causing the figure to stop suddenly in the middle
of its movement, and involving the re-winding or
oiling of its internal mechanism, will also produce
a good deal of amusement. The “winding up”
may be done with a bed-winch, a bottle-jack key,
or the winch of a kitchen range, the click of the
mechanism being imitated by means of a watchman’s
rattle, or by the even simpler expedient of
drawing a piece of hard wood smartly along
a notched stick. (This, of course, should be done
out of sight of the audience.) The movement of
the figure should be accompanied by the piano, to
a slow or lively measure, as may be most appropriate.</p>

<p>The arrangement being complete, and the curtain
raised, Mrs. Jarley delivers her opening
speech, about as follows:—</p>

<p>“Ladies and Gentlemen,—You here behold Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Jarley! one of the most remarkable women of the
world, who has traveled all over the country with
her curious Collection of Waxworks. These figures
have been gathered, at great expense, from
every clime and country, and are here shown
together for the first time. I shall describe each
one of them for your benefit, and, after I have
given you their history, I shall have each one of
them wound up, for they are all fitted with clockwork
inside, and they can thus go through the
same motions they did when living. In fact, they
execute their movements so naturally that many
people have supposed them to be alive; but I
assure you that they are all made of wood and
wax;—blockheads every one.</p>

<p>“Without further prelude, I shall now introduce
to your notice each one of my figures, beginning,
as usual, with the last one first.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">i. The Chinese Giant.</span></h3>

<div class="hang1">A man or woman standing on a high stool, chintz
skirt round the waist, long enough to hide the
stool, Chinese over-dress, hat, pig-tail, and
moustache.</div>

<p>“This figure is universally allowed to be the
tallest figure in my collection; he originated in
the two provinces of Oolong and Shang-high, one
province not being long enough to produce him.
On account of his extreme length it is impossible
to give any adequate idea of him in one entertainment;
consequently he will be continued in our
next.</p>

<p>“He was the inventor, projector, and discoverer
of Niagara Falls, Bunker’s Hill Monument, and
the Balm of Columbia. In fact, everything was
originally discovered by him or some other of the
Chinese. The portrait of this person, who was a
high dignitary among them, may be often seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
depicted on a blue china plate, standing upon a
bridge, which leans upon nothing at either end,
and intently observing two birds which are behind
him in the distance.</p>

<p>“John, wind up the Giant.”</p>

<p>The Giant bows low, then wags his head three
times, and bows as before, and after a dozen motions
slowly stops.</p>

<p>“You will observe that I have spared no expense
in procuring wonders of every sort, and here is my
crowning effort or master-piece.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">ii. The Two-Headed Girl.</span></h3>

<p>“A remarkable freak of Nature, which impresses
the beholder with silent awe. ‘Observe the two
heads and one body.’ ‘See these fair faces, each
one lovelier than the other.’ No one can gaze upon
them without a double sensation ‘of sorrow and
of joy’—sorrow that such beauty and grace were
ever united, and joy that he has had the pleasure
of contemplating their union.</p>

<p>“Wind them up, Peter.”</p>

<p>This figure is made by two young ladies standing
back to back wrapped in one large skirt. They
hold their arms out with their hands hanging, and
slowly revolve when they are wound up.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">iii. The Sewing Woman.</span></h3>

<p>“John, bring out the Sewing Woman, and let
the ladies behold the unfortunate seamstress who
died from pricking her finger with a needle while
sewing on Sunday. You see that the work which
she holds is stained with gore, which drips from
her finger on to the floor. (Which is poetry!)
This forms a sad and melancholy warning to all
heads of families immediately to purchase the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
sewing-machines, for this accident never could have
happened had she not been without one of those
excellent machines, as no family should be.”</p>

<p>Costume.—Optional.</p>

<p>When wound up the figure sews very stiffly and
stops slowly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">iv. Captain Kidd and his Victim.</span></h3>

<p>“Ladies and Gentlemen,—Permit me to call
your attention to this beautiful group, which has
lately been added at an enormous expense to my
collection. You here behold the first privateer and
the first victim of his murderous propensities.
Captain Kidd, the robber of the main, is supposed
to have originated somewhere down east. His
whole life being spent upon the stormy deep, he
amassed an immense fortune, and buried it in the
sand along the flower-clad banks of Cape Cod, by
which course he invented the Savings Banks, now
so common along shore. Having hidden away so
much property, which, like so many modern investments,
never can be unearthed, he was known
as a great sea-cretur. Before him kneels his
lovely and innocent victim, the Lady Blousabella
Infantina, who was several times taken and murdered
by this bloodthirsty tyrant, which accounts
for the calm look of resignation depicted upon her
lovely countenance.</p>

<p>“Wind ’em up, John.”</p>

<p>Costumes.—Captain Kidd—White pantaloons,
blue shirt, sailor hat, pistol, and sword.</p>

<p>Victim.—Lady with flowing hair, white dress.</p>

<p>Movement.—The Captain’s sword moves up and
down, and the victim’s arms go in unison.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">v. The Siamese Twins.</span></h3>

<p>Two gentlemen dressed alike in ordinary costume;
with a large bone (attached by wire or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
string) between them. One arm of each over
the other’s neck. Pugnacious expression of countenance.</p>

<p>“The Wonderful Siamese Twins compose the
next group. These remarkable brothers lived together
in the greatest harmony, though there was
always a bone of contention between them. They
were never seen apart, such was their brotherly
fondness. They married young, both being
opposed to a single life. The short one is not
quite so tall as his brother, although their ages
are about the same. One of them was born in the
Island of Borneo, the other on the southern extremity
of Cape Cod.”</p>

<p>When wound up they begin to fight, continue
for a moment, and stop suddenly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">vi. The Celebrated Dwarf.</span></h3>

<p>Boy with red cloak, long white wig, bowl and
spoon.</p>

<p>“This wonderful child has created some interest
in the medical and scientific world, from the fact
that he was thirteen years old when he was born,
and kept on growing older and older until he died,
at the somewhat advanced age of two hundred and
ninety-seven, in consequence of eating too freely
of pies and cakes, his favorite food. He measured
exactly two feet and seven inches from the
crown of his head to the sole of his foot, and two
feet and ten inches back again. Was first discovered
ten miles from any land, and twelve miles
from any water, making the enormous total of
ninety-one, which figure was never before reached
by any previous exhibition. Wind him up, John.”</p>

<p>Dwarf eats very stiffly with a large spoon in his
right hand; in his left hand he holds a bowl,
which falls on the floor after a moment, and is
broken.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>“John, get your tools and screw up that dwarfs
hand, for it has become so loose that it costs a fortune
for the crockery he breaks.”</p>

<p>John screws up the hand, gets a new bowl, and
again winds up the figure, which now moves with
much greater energy.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">vii. The Vocalist.</span></h3>

<p>“Bring out the Vocalist. I now call your attention
to the most costly of all my figures. This
wonderful automaton singer represents Signorina
Squallini, the unrivaled Vocalist, whose notes are
current in every market, and sway all hearts, at
her own sweet will.</p>

<p>“Wind her up, and let her liquid notes pour
forth.”</p>

<p>She gesticulates wildly, and sings a few notes
in a very extravagant manner, then stops with a
hoarse sound.</p>

<p>Mrs. J.—“John, this figure needs oiling. Why
do you not attend to your duties better?”</p>

<p>John gets oil-can, which he applies to each ear of
the figure, which strikes a high note, and sings
with much expression and many trills, then
makes a gurgling sound, as if running down, and
suddenly stops again.</p>

<p>Costume.—Evening dress.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">viii. The Yankee.</span></h3>

<p>Description.—A tall, thin man, clean shaven but
for a tuft on chin, dressed in black, with broad-brimmed
straw hat. He is seated on a low rocking-chair,
with his legs resting on the back of
another chair. He holds a wooden stick, which he
is whittling with a jack-knife.</p>

<p>“You here behold a specimen of our irrepressible,
indomitable, native Yankee, who has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
everywhere, seen everything, and knows everybody.
He has explored the arid jungles of Africa,
drawn forth the spotted cobra by his prehensile
tail, snowballed the Russian bear on the snowy
slopes of Alpine forests, and sold wooden nutmegs
to the unsuspecting innocents of Patagonia. He
has peddled patent medicines in the desert of
Sahara, and hung his hat and carved his name on
the extreme top of the North Pole. The only
difficulty I find in describing him is that I cannot
tell what he cannot do. I will therefore set him
in motion, as he hates to be quiet.”</p>

<p>When wound up he pushes his hat back on his
head and begins to whittle.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">ix. The Cannibal.</span></h3>

<p>“Here you behold a curious Cannibal from the
Feejee Islands, first discovered by Captain Cook,
who came very near being cooked by him. In
that case the worthy Captain would never have
completed his celebrated voyage round the world.
This individual was greatly interested in the cause
of foreign missions. Indeed, he received the missionaries
gladly, and gave them a place near his
heart. He was finally converted by a very tough
tract distributor, who had been brought up in a
Bloomsbury boarding-house, and was induced to
become civilized. One of his evidences of a change
of life was shown by his statement that he now
had but one wife, like the English. ‘What have
you done with the other twelve which you said
you had a month ago?’ asked the tract distributor.
‘Oh, I have eaten them!’ replied the gentle savage.
This Cannibal was very fond of children, especially
those of a tender age; he holds in his
hand a war-club, with which he prepared his daily
meals, also a war-whoop, which is an original
one.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>Costume.—Brown jersey and drawers, face and
hands colored to match, very short skirt, feather
head-dress, large rings in nose and ears. One hand
holds a war-club, the other a child’s hoop.</p>

<p>Movement.—When wound up he brandishes his
club and raises hoop to his mouth.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">x. Babes in the Wood.</span></h3>

<p>Two men, the bigger the better, one dressed as a
very small boy, the other as a little girl; each
holds a penny bun.</p>

<p>“In the next group you behold the Babes in the
Wood, who had the misfortune to have an uncle.
This wicked man hired a villain to carry these
babes away into the wood and leave them to
wander until death put an end to their sorrow, and
the little robins covered them up with leaves.
These lifelike figures represent the children just
after taking their leaves of the villain. By a master
stroke of genius the artist has shown very delicately
that human nature is not utterly depraved,
for the villain has placed in the hand of each of
the innocents a penny bun as a parting present. I
have been often asked ‘why I did not have a figure
of the villain also added to the group?’ but my
reply always is, ‘Villains are too common to be
any curiosity.’</p>

<p>“Wind ’em up, John.”</p>

<p>Each Babe offers to the other a bite of bun alternately.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">xi. Little Red Riding-Hood.</span></h3>

<p>A young lady carrying a basket on her arm.
Costume in accordance with the story.</p>

<p>“Here you behold Little Red Riding-Hood, a
model of grand-filial devotion, for she was so fond
of her granny that she wandered through the forest
to take the old lady’s luncheon, and was eaten by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the wolf for so doing, which is a warning to all
children to be careful how they do much for their
grandmothers, unless they are rich and can leave
them something in their wills. This personage
was an especial favorite with children, who love to
read about her, and shed tears over her unhappy
fate, although some of them think that had she
been as smart as her dress, she would have been
too smart to have mistaken the wolf for her grandmother,
unless <i>she</i> had been a very homely old
lady, or <i>he</i> had been much better-looking than
most wolves.”</p>

<p>When wound up, the figure curtseys and holds
out her basket.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">xii. Lady with Golden Locks.</span></h3>

<p>Young lady, with long fair hair, flowing over her
shoulders; holds bottle (labelled Mrs. Blank’s Hair
Restorer) and curling-tongs.</p>

<p>“This is one of the most expensive of my costly
collection, for blonde hair is very high, and you
see how heavy and long are the golden locks which
adorn her beautiful face. I cannot pass this figure
without saying a few words in praise of the wonderful
Hair Restorer, for this image had grown so
bald from the effect of long journeys by road or
rail that she was exhibited for two years as the Old
Man of the Mountain. One bottle of this wonderful
fluid, however, restored her hair to its present
growth and beauty, and a little of the fluid being
accidentally spilled upon the pine box in which the
figure was carried, it immediately became an excellent
hair-trunk.”</p>

<p>When wound up the lady applies the hair-restorative
and curls her hair.</p>

<p>“You have all gazed with rapture upon my
wonderful Collection, and your bewildered senses
may now prepare for a new sensation, as I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
about to wind up all these beautiful and lifelike
figures at once, so that you can see them all work
together in harmony.</p>

<p>“John, set all the Waxworks going.</p>

<p>“I thank you for your attention and attendance,
and cordially invite you all to come again to-morrow
and see ‘Jarley’s Far-famed Waxworks.’”</p>

<p>All the figures being wound up at once go
through their motions in unison.</p>

<h2>OPTICAL ILLUSIONS.</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Raising a Ghost.</span></h3>

<p>Place a small magic lantern in a box large
enough to contain a small swing dressing-glass,
which will reflect the light thrown on it by the
lantern in such a way, that it will pass out at the
aperture made at the top of the box, which aperture
should be oval, and of a size adapted to the cone
of light to pass through it. There should be a flap
with hinges, to cover the opening, that the inside
of the box may not be seen. There must be holes
in that part of the box which is over the lantern,
to let the smoke out; and over this must be placed
a chafing-dish, of an oblong figure, large enough to
hold several lighted coals. This chafing-dish, for
the better carrying on the deception, may be inclosed
in a painted tin box, about a foot high, with
a hole at top, and should stand on four feet, to let
the smoke of the lantern escape. There must also
be a glass planned to move up and down in the
groove, and so managed by a cord and pulley, that
it may be raised up and let down by the cord coming
through the outside of the box. On this glass,
the spectre (or any other figure you please) must
be painted, in a contracted or squat form, as the
figure will reflect a greater length than it is drawn.
When you have lighted the lamp in the lantern,
and placed the mirror in a proper direction, put
the box on a table, and, setting the chafing-dish in
it, throw some incense in powder on the coals.
You then open the trap door and let down the
glass in the grove slowly, and when you perceive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the smoke diminish, draw up the glass that the
figure may disappear, and shut the trap door. This
exhibition will afford much wonder. The lights
in the room must be extinguished; and the box
should be placed on a high table, that the aperture
through which the light comes out may not be
seen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Magic Lantern Trick.</span></h3>

<p>The light of the magic lantern, and the color of
images, may not only be painted on a cloth, but
also reflected by a cloud of smoke. Provide a box
of wood or pasteboard, about four feet high, and
seven or eight inches square at bottom, but diminishing
as it ascends, so that its aperture at top be
but six inches long, and half an inch wide. At the
bottom of this box there must be a door that shuts
quite close, by which you are to place in the box a
chafing-dish with hot coals, on which is to be
thrown incense, whose smoke goes out in a cloud
at the top of the box: on this cloud, you are to
throw the light that comes out of the lantern, and
which you bring into a smaller compass by drawing
out the movable tube. In this representation,
the motion of the smoke does not at all change the
figures; which appear so conspicuous that the
spectator thinks he can grasp them with his hand.
In the experiment, some of the rays passing
through the smoke, the representation will be much
less vivid than on the cloth; and if care be not
taken to reduce the light to its smallest focus, it
will be still more imperfect.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Phantasmagoria.</span></h3>

<p>In showing the common magic lantern, the spectators
see a round circle of light with the figures in
the middle of it; but, in the Phantasmagoria, they
see the figures only, without any circle of light.
The exhibition is produced by a magic lantern,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
placed on that side of a half transparent screen
which is opposite to that on which the spectators
are, instead of being on the same side, as in the ordinary
exhibition of the magic lantern. To favor
the deception, the slides are made perfectly opaque,
except in those places that contain the figures to be
exhibited, and in these light parts the glass is covered
with a more or less transparent tint, according
to the effect required. The easiest way is to draw
the figures with water colors on thin paper, and
afterward varnish them. To imitate the natural
motions of the objects represented, several pieces
of glass, placed behind each other, are occasionally
employed. By removing the lantern to different
distances, and at the same time, altering, more or
less, the position of the lens, the images are made
to increase and diminish, and to become more or
less distinct at the pleasure of the exhibitor; so
that, to a person unacquainted with the effect of
optical instruments, these figures appear actually
to advance and recede. Transparent screens for
the Phantasmagoria are prepared by spreading
white wax, dissolved in spirits of wine or oil of turpentine,
over thin muslin: a screen so prepared
may be rolled up without injury. A clearer screen
may be produced, by having the muslin always
strained upon a rectangular frame, and preparing
it with turpentine, instead of wax: but such a
screen is not always convenient, and cannot be
rolled without cracking, and becoming, in a short
time useless.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chinese Shadows.</span></h3>

<p>Cut out an aperture in a partition wall, of any
size; for example, four feet in length and two in
breadth, so that the lower edge may be about five
feet from the floor, and cover it with white Italian
gauze, varnished with gum-copal. Provide several
frames of the same size as the aperture, covered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
the same kind of gauze, and delineate upon the
gauze different figures, such as landscapes and
buildings, analogous to the scenes which you intend
to exhibit by means of small figures representing
men and animals. These figures are formed of pasteboard,
and their different parts are made movable,
according to the effect intended to be produced by
their shadows, when moved backward and forward
behind the frames, at a small distance from them.
To make them act with more facility, small wires,
fixed to their movable parts, are bent backward,
and made to terminate in rings, through which the
fingers of the hand are put, while the figure is supported
by the left, by means of another iron wire.
In this manner they may be made to advance or
recede, and to gesticulate, without the spectators
observing the mechanism by which they are
moved; and as the shadow of these figures is not
observed on the paintings till they are opposite
those parts which are not strongly shaded, they
may thus be concealed, and made to appear at the
proper moments, and others may be occasionally
substituted in their stead.</p>

<p>It is necessary, when the figures are made to act,
to speak a dialogue, suited to their gestures, and
imitate the noise occasioned by different circumstances.
The paintings must be illuminated from
behind by means of a reverberating lamp, placed
opposite to the centre of the painting, and distant
from it about four or five feet. Various amusing
scenes may be represented in this manner, by employing
small figures of men and animals, and
making them move in as natural a way as possible,
which will depend on the address and practice of
the person who exhibits them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Wonderful Mirror.</span></h3>

<p>Make two openings, of a foot high, and ten inches
wide, and about a foot distant from each other, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
the wainscoting of a wall; let them be at the common
height of a man’s head; and in each of them
place a transparent glass, surrounded with a frame,
like a common mirror. Behind this partition place
two mirrors, one on the outward side of each opening,
inclined to the wainscot at an angle of forty-five
degrees; let them both be eighteen inches
square; let all the space between them be enclosed
by boards or pasteboard, painted black, and well
closed, that no light may enter; let there be also
two curtains to cover them, which may be drawn
aside at pleasure. When a person looks into one
of these supposed mirrors, instead of seeing his own
face he will perceive the object that is in the front
of the other; so that, if two persons present themselves
at the same time before these mirrors, instead
of each one seeing himself they will reciprocally
see each other. There should be a sconce with a
candle or lamp placed on each side of the two
glasses in the wainscot, to enlighten the faces of
the persons who look in them, otherwise this experiment
will have no remarkable effect.</p>

<p>This recreation may be considerably improved
by placing the two glasses in the wainscot in adjoining
rooms, and a number of persons being previously
placed in one room, when a stranger enters
the other, you may tell him his face is dirty, and
desire him to look in the glass, which he will naturally
do; and on seeing a strange face he will
draw back; but returning to it, and seeing another,
another, and another, what his surprise will be is
more easy to conceive than express.</p>

<p>When one looks in a mirror placed perpendicularly
to another, his face will appear entirely
deformed. If the mirror be a little inclined, so as
to make an angle of eighty degrees (that is, one-ninth
part from the perpendicular), he will then
see all the parts of his face, except the nose and
forehead; if it be inclined to sixty degrees (that is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
one-third part), he will appear with three noses and
six eyes; in short, the apparent deformity will vary
at each degree of inclination; and when the glass
comes to forty-five degrees (that is, half-way down),
the face will vanish. If, instead of placing the
two mirrors in this situation, they are so disposed
that their junction may be vertical, their different
inclinations will produce other effects; as the
situation of the object relative to these mirrors is
quite different.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Disappearing Paper.</span></h3>

<p>Attach to a dark wall a round piece of paper an
inch or two in diameter, and, a little lower, at the
distance of two feet on each side, make two marks;
then place yourself directly opposite to the paper,
and hold the end of your finger before your face in
such a manner, that when the right eye is open, it
shall conceal the mark on the left, and, when the
left eye is open, the mark on the right; if you
then look with both eyes to the end of your finger,
the paper, which is not at all concealed by it from
either of your eyes, will, nevertheless, disappear.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Multiplied Money.</span></h3>

<p>Take a large drinking-glass, of a conical form,
that is, small at bottom and wide at top, and,
having put into it a dime, let it be half filled with
water; then place a plate upon the top of the glass,
and turn it quickly over, that the water may not
get out; a piece of silver as large as half a dollar
will immediately appear on the plate, and somewhat
higher up another piece of the size of a dime.</p>

<h2>SLEIGHT OF HAND.</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Balance an Egg.</span></h3>

<p>Lay a looking glass upon an even table; take a
fresh egg, and shake it for some time, so that the
yolk may be broken and mixed up with the white.
You may then balance it on its point, and make it
stand on the glass. This it would be impossible to
do if the egg was in its natural state.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Juggler’s Lunch.</span></h3>

<p>Pare some large apples that are rather of a yellow
tint; cut several pieces out of them in the
shape of a candle-end, round, of course, at the
bottom, and square at the top; in fact, as much as
possible like a candle that has burnt down within
an inch or so. Then, cut some slips out of the
insides of sweet almonds, fashion them as much in
the shape of spermaceti wicks as you can, stick them
into your mock candles, light them for an instant,
so as to make their tops black, blow them out
again, and they are ready for use. When you produce
them, light them (the almond will readily take
fire, and flame for a few moments), put them into
your mouth, chew and swallow them one after
another.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ring and Ribbon.</span></h3>

<p>Select two pieces of ribbon, alike in length,
breadth, and color; double each separately, so that
the ends meet; then tie them together neatly,
with a bit of silk of their own color, by the middle,
or crease made in doubling them. This must all be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
done in advance. When you are going to exhibit
this trick, pass some rings on the doubled ribbons,
and give the two ends of one ribbon to one person
to hold, and the two ends of the other to another.
Do not let them pull hard, or the silk will break,
and your trick be discovered by the rings falling
on the ground, on account of the separation of the
ribbons. Request the two persons to approach
each other, and take one end from each of them,
and without their perceiving it, return to each of
them the end which the other had previously held.
By now giving the rings, which appeared strung on
the ribbon, a slight pull, you may break the silk,
and they will fall into your hand.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Changing Ball Trick.</span></h3>

<p>Take a ball in each hand, and stretch your hands
as far as you can, one from the other; then state
that you will contrive to make both the balls come
into either hand, without bringing the hands near
each other. If any one dispute your power of doing
this, you have no more to do than to lay one ball
down upon the table, turn yourself, and take it up
with your other hand. Thus both the balls will be
in one of your hands, without their approaching
each other.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Sensitive Goblet.</span></h3>

<p>To fill a glass with water, so that no one may
touch it without spilling all the water. Fill a common
glass or goblet with water, and place upon it
a bit of paper, so as to cover the water and edge of
the glass; put the palm of your hand on the paper,
and taking hold of the glass with the other, suddenly
invert it on a very smooth table, and gently
draw out the paper; the water will remain suspended
in the glass, and it will be impossible to
move the glass without spilling all the water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Light a Candle by Smoke.</span></h3>

<p>When a candle is burnt so long as to leave a tolerably
large wick, blow it out; a dense smoke,
which is composed of hydrogen and carbon, will
immediately arise. Then, if another candle, or
lighted taper, be applied to the utmost verge of
this smoke, a very strange phenomenon will take
place; the flame of the lighted candle will be conveyed
to that just blown out, as if it were borne on
a cloud, or, rather, it will seem like a mimic flash
of lightning proceeding at a slow rate.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Magic Re-illumination.</span></h3>

<p>After having exhibited the trick of lighting a candle
by smoke, privately put a bit of paper between
your fingers, and retire to one corner of the room
with a single candle, and pass the hand in which
you hold the paper several times slowly over the
candle until the paper takes fire; then immediately
blow the candle out, and presently pass your hand
over the snuff and relight it with the paper. You
may then crumple the paper, at the same time extinguishing
the flame, by squeezing it suddenly,
without burning yourself. If this trick be performed
dextrously, it is a very good one. It is not
necessary for the performance of this trick that all
the other lights in the room should be extinguished;
in fact the trick is more liable to discovery
in a dark room, than in one where the candles
are burning, on account of the light thrown out by
the paper while it is burning, previous to the re-illumination.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fascinated by a Feather.</span></h3>

<p>Take a bird and lay it on a table; then wave a
small feather over its eyes, and it will appear as
dead, but taking the feather away, it will revive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
again. Let it lay hold of the stem part of the
feather, and it will twist and turn like a parrot;
you may likewise roll it about, on the table, just
as you please.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Moving Ball.</span></h3>

<p>Roll up a piece of paper, or other light substance,
and privately put into it any small insect,
such as a lady-bird, or beetle; then, as the creature
will naturally endeavor to free itself from captivity,
it will move its covering toward the edge of the
table, and when it comes there, will immediately
return, for fear of falling; and thus, by moving
backward and forward, will excite much diversion
to those who are ignorant of the cause.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Paper Furnace.</span></h3>

<p>Enclose a bullet in paper, as smoothly as possible,
and suspend it above the flame of a lamp or
candle; you will soon see it melt and fall, drop by
drop, through a hole which it will make in the
paper; but the paper, except the hole mentioned,
will not be burnt. The art of performing this trick
consists in using a smooth round bullet, and enclosing
it in the paper with but few folds or uneven
places.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Storm and Calm.</span></h3>

<p>Pour water into a glass until it is nearly three
parts full; then almost fill it up with oil; but be
sure to leave a little space between the oil and the
top of the glass. Tie a bit of string round the
glass, and fasten the two ends of another piece of
string to it, one on each side, so that, when you
take hold of the middle of it to lift up the glass, it
may be about a foot from your hand. Now swing
the glass to and fro, and the oil will be smooth and
unruffled, while the surface of the water beneath
it will be violently agitated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Knotted Thread.</span></h3>

<p>A good deal of amusement may be occasioned by
this trick. It is most frequently performed by a
lady, but the effect of it is considerably increased
when it is displayed by a boy. A piece of calico,
muslin, or linen, is taken in the left hand, a needle
is threaded in the presence of the spectators, and
the usual, or even a double or treble knot made at
the extremity of one of the ends of it. The operator
commences his work by drawing the needle
and the thread in it quite through the linen, notwithstanding
the knot, and continues to make
several stitches in like manner successively. The
mode of performing this seeming wonder, is as
follows: a bit of thread, about a quarter of a yard
long, is turned once round the top of the middle
finger of the right hand, upon which a thimble is
then placed to keep it secure. This must be done
privately and the thread kept concealed, while a
needle is threaded with a bit of thread of a similar
length. The thread in the needle must have one
of its ends drawn up nearly close, and be concealed
between the forefinger and thumb; the other
should hang down nearly as long as, and by the
side of the thread, which is fastened under the
thimble, so that these two may appear to be the
two ends of the thread. The end of the piece that
is fastened under the thimble is then knotted, and
the performer begins to sew, by moving his hand
quickly after he has taken up the stitch. It will
appear as though he actually passed the knotted
thread through the cloth.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Imps of the Bottle.</span></h3>

<p>Take three little hollow figures of glass, an inch
and a half high, representing imps, which may be
obtained at a glass-blowers, with a small hole in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
each of their legs. Submerge them in water in a
glass bottle, which should be about fifteen inches
high, and covered with a bladder tied over the top.
A small quantity of air must be left between the
bladder and the surface of the water. When you
think fit to command the figures to go down, press
your hand hard upon the top, and they will immediately
sink; when you would have them rise to
the top, take your hand away, and they will float
up. By these means, you may make them dance
in the middle of the glass at your pleasure.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Bird in the Box.</span></h3>

<p>Take a box made with a false lid, on which glue
some bird-seed; privately put a bird into it, under
the false lid; then show it, and it will seem to be
full of seed. Put on the true lid, and say,—“I
will command all the seed out of this box, and
order a living bird to appear.” Take off the covers
together, and the bird will be seen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Multiplying Mirror.</span></h3>

<p>This must be performed with a looking-glass
made on purpose; the manner of making it is this:—First,
make a hoop, or fillet of wood or horn,
about the size of a half-dollar in circumference,
and about a quarter of an inch in thickness. In
the middle, fasten a bottom of wood or brass, and
bore in it several small holes, about the size of
peas; then open one side of this bottom, set in a
piece of crystal-glass, and fasten it in the hoop
close to the bottom. Take a quantity of quicksilver,
and put as much into the hoop as will cover
the bottom; then let into it another piece of crystal-glass,
fitted to it; cement the sides, that the
quicksilver may not run out, and the apparatus is
complete. One side will reflect the beholder’s face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
as a common looking-glass; in the other it will be
multiplied according to the number of holes in the
wood or brass.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Half-dollar Upheld.</span></h3>

<p>Privately cut the rim of the edge which is raised
to protect the face of a half-dollar, so that a little
bit of the silver may stick up; take the coin in your
right hand, and by pressing it with your thumb
against a door or wainscot, the bit that sticks up
will enter the wood, and thus support the half-dollar.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Bowing Beau.</span></h3>

<p>Make a figure, resembling a man, of any substance,
exceedingly light, such as the pith of the
alder tree, which is soft, and can easily be cut into
any form: then provide for it a hemispherical
base, of some very heavy substance, such as the
half of a leaden bullet, made very smooth on the
convex part. Cement the figure to the plane part
of the hemisphere; and, in whatever position it is
placed, when left to itself, it will rise upright. The
figure of a beau, or master of the ceremonies, is
appropriate for this trick.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Vanishing Wafers.</span></h3>

<p>On each side of a table-knife, place, in the presence
of your company, three wafers. Take the
knife by the handle, and turn it over two or three
times, to show that the wafers are all on. Desire
some person to take off one wafer from one side of
the blade; turn the knife two or three times again,
and there will appear only two wafers on each side;
remove another wafer, turn the knife as before, and
there will appear only one wafer on each side; take
the third wafer away, turn the knife as before twice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
or thrice, and there will appear to be no wafer on
either side. After a momentary pause, turn the
knife again two or three times, and three wafers will
appear on each side.</p>

<p>The secret of this capital trick consists in using
wafers of the same size and color, and turning the
knife, so that the same side is constantly presented
to the view, and the wafers are taken off that side,
one by one. The three wafers will thus remain untouched
on the other side, so that when you have
first made it appear that there are no wafers on
either side, you may, apparently, show three on
each, by the same means. The way to turn the
knife is as follows: when you lift it up, turn it in
your hand, with your finger and thumb, completely
round, until the side that was uppermost when you
lifted it, comes uppermost again. This is done in
an instant, and is not perceptible, if adroitly managed.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Cut Lace Joined.</span></h3>

<p>Conceal a piece of lace in your hand; then produce
another piece of the same pattern; double
the latter, and put the fold between your forefinger
and thumb, with the piece which you have previously
concealed, doubled in the same manner;
pull out a little of the latter, so as to make a loop,
and desire one of the company to cut it asunder.
If you have conveyed the concealed piece of lace
so dexterously as to be undetected, with the other
between your thumb and forefinger, the spectators
will, naturally enough think you have really cut
the latter; which you may seem to make whole
again, while repeating some conjuring words, and
putting away the two ends of the piece that is actually
cut.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Vanishing Dime.</span></h3>

<p>Stick a little wax upon your thumb, take a bystander
by the fingers, show him a dime, and tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
him you will put the same into his hand; then
wring it down hard with your waxed thumb, and,
using many words, look him in the face; suddenly
take away your thumb, and the coin will adhere to
it; then close his hand; it will seem to him
that the dime remains; now tell him to open his
hand, and, if you perform the feat cleverly, to his
great astonishment, he will find nothing in it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Adhesive Stick.</span></h3>

<p>This feat has astonished crowds of spectators.
It was one of the favorites of a late popular professor,
and is now first promulgated. Before you
perform it in public, you must practice it, until
you are quite perfect, in private, for it would be a
pity to spoil its effect by making a blunder in it.
Begin by stating very seriously, what is a well-known
fact, that if a bucket full of water be hurled
round his head by a man, who is sufficiently strong,
none of the water will fall out. If this be at all
discredited, be prepared not only to support your
assertion, but to carry the point still further by
placing a tumbler full of any liquid in the inside
of a broad hoop, which you hold in your hand by
a small piece of string fixed to it, and twirling it
round at your side. If you do this with velocity,
although the tumbler, in the circles made by the
hoop, is frequently quite bottom upward, it will
neither fall from the hoop, nor will any of the
water be spilt. To do this, however, requires even
more practice than the trick which it prefaces; as,
although there is no difficulty in it while the hoop
is in rapid motion, yet there is some danger until
you are rendered expert by practice, of the tumbler’s
falling, when you begin to put the hoop in
motion, and when you wish to stop it. If, therefore,
you are not perfectly capable of doing it, state
the fact only, which some or other of your auditors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
will most probably support, as it is pretty generally
known. You now go on to say, that the air, under
the water in the glass, when it is topsy-turvey,
keeps it in; and that upon the same principle, if
you can turn your hand, upon which you place a
piece of thin wood (about one inch broad, and six
inches long), sufficiently quick, although the back
be uppermost, the air will actually keep the wood
up against the palm of your hand, without any
support. This they will be readily inclined to believe.
They will, however, doubt your being possessed
of sufficient manual dexterity to perform it
quick enough.</p>

<p>We must now tell you how it is to be done:—Lay
the piece of wood across the palm of your left
hand, which keep wide open, with the thumb and
all the fingers far apart, lest you be suspected of
supporting the wood with them. Next, take your
left wrist in your right hand, and grasp it
tightly, for the purpose, as you state, of giving the
hand more steadiness. Now, suddenly turn the
back of your left hand uppermost, and, as your
wrist moves in your right hand, stretch out the
forefinger of your right hand, and as soon as the
wood comes undermost, support it with such forefinger.
You may now shake the hand, and, after
a moment or two, suffer the wood to drop. It is
two to one but the spectators will admit it to be
produced by the action of the air, as you had previously
stated, and try to do it themselves; but,
of course, they must, unless you have performed
the feat so awkwardly as to be discovered, fail in its
performance. If you have no objection to reveal
the secret, you can do it again, and, while they are
gravely philosophizing upon it, suddenly lift up
your hand and expose the trick. This will,
doubtless, create much amusement. Observe that
in doing this feat, you must keep your fingers
so low, that no one can see the palm of your left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
hand; and move your finger so carefully, that its
action may not be detected; and if it be not, you
may rest satisfied that its absence from round the
wrist of the left hand will not be discovered, some
of the fingers being naturally supposed to be under
the coat; so that, if the spectators only see two or
even one, they will imagine the others are beneath
the cuff. There is one other observation necessary
before we conclude; it is this, when you have
turned your hand over, do not keep the stick too
long upheld, lest the spectators should take hold
of your hands, and discover the trick; before their
astonishment has ceased, adroitly remove your
forefinger, and suffer the stick to fall to the
ground.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Magic Thread.</span></h3>

<p>Take two pieces of thread, one foot in length
each; roll one of them round, like a small pea,
which put between your left forefinger and thumb.
Now, hold the other out at length, between the
forefinger and thumb of each hand; then let some
one cut the same asunder in the middle; when
that is done, put the tops of your two thumbs together,
so that you may, with less suspicion,
receive the thread which you hold in your right
hand into your left, without opening your left
finger and thumb. Then, holding these two pieces
as you did before, let them be cut asunder in the
middle also, and conveyed again as before, until
they be very short; then roll all the ends together,
and keep that ball of thread before the other in the
left hand, and with a knife, thrust the same into a
candle, where you may hold it until it be burnt to
ashes; pull back the knife with your right hand,
and leave the ashes, with the other ball, between
your forefinger and thumb of your left hand, and
with the two thumbs and forefingers together,
rub the ashes, and at length, draw out that thread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
which has been all this time between your forefinger
and thumb.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Long Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>The following is a famous feat among those
mountebanks who travel the country with quack
doctors. This pudding must be made of twelve or
thirteen little tin hoops, so as to fall one through
another, and little holes should be made at the
biggest end, so that it may not hurt your mouth;
hold it privately in your left hand, with the hole
end uppermost, and, with your right hand, take a
ball out of your pocket, and say, “if there be any
old lady that is out of conceit with herself, because
her neighbors deem her not so young as she would
be thought, let her come to me, for this ball is a
certain remedy;” then seem to put the ball into
your left hand, but let it slip into your lap, and
clap your pudding into your mouth, which will be
thought to be the ball that you showed them;
then decline your head, open your mouth, and the
pudding will slip down to its full length; with
your right hand you may strike it into your
mouth again; after having done this three or four
times, you may discharge it into your hand, and
put it into your pocket without any suspicion, by
making three or four wry faces after it, as though
it had been too large for your throat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Changeable Watch.</span></h3>

<p>Borrow a watch from any person in company,
and request the whole to stand round you. Hold
the watch up to the ear of the first in the circle,
and command it to go; then demand his testimony
to the fact. Remove it to the ear of the
next, and enjoin it to stop; make the same request
to that person, and so on throughout the
entire party.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Explanation.</i> You must take care, in borrowing
the watch, that it be a good one, and goes well.
Conceal in your hand a piece of loadstone which,
so soon as you apply it to the watch, will occasion
a suspension of the movements, which a subsequent
shaking and withdrawing of the magnet
will restore. For this purpose, keep the magnet
in one hand and shift the watch alternately from
one hand to the other.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Vanishing Ring.</span></h3>

<p>You may cause a ring to shift from one hand to
another, and make it go on any finger required on
the other hand, while somebody holds both your
arms, in order to prevent communication between
them by attending to these instructions:—Desire
some lady in company to lend you a gold ring,
recommending her, at the same time, to make a
mark on it, that she may know it again. Have a
gold ring of your own, which fasten by a small
piece of catgut-string, to a watch-barrel, and sew
it to the left sleeve of your coat. Take the ring
that is given you in your right hand; then putting,
with dexterity, the other ring fastened to the
watch-barrel, near the entrance of your sleeve,
draw it privately to the fingers’ ends of your left
hand. During this operation, hide the ring that
has been lent to you between the fingers of your
right hand, and fasten it dexterously on a little
hook, sewed for the purpose, on your waistcoat,
and hidden by your coat. After that show your
ring, which hold in your left hand; then ask the
company on which finger of the other hand they
wish it to pass. During this interval, and as soon
as the answer has been given, put the before-mentioned
finger on the little hook, in order to
slip the ring on it; at that moment let go the other
ring, by opening your fingers. The spring which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
is in the watch-barrel, being confined no longer,
will contract, and make the ring slip under the
sleeve, without anybody perceiving it, not even
those who hold your arms; as their attention will
be occupied to prevent your hands from communicating.
After this operation, show the assembly
that the ring is come on the other hand; and make
them remark that it is the same that had been lent
to you, or that the mark is right. Much dexterity
must be made use of to succeed in this entertaining
trick, that the deception may not be suspected.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Handkerchief Trick.</span></h3>

<p>This feat, strange as it appears, is very simple;
the performer must have a confederate, who has
two handkerchiefs of the same quality, and with
the same mark, one of which he throws upon the
table, to perform the feat with. The performer
takes care to put this handkerchief uppermost in
making a bundle, though he affects to mix them
together promiscuously. The person, whom he
desires to draw one of the handkerchiefs, naturally
takes that which comes first to hand. The performer
then desires to shake them again to embellish
the operation; but in so doing, takes care to
bring the right handkerchief uppermost, and carefully
fixes upon some simpleton to draw; and if
he find the person is not likely to take the first
that comes to hand, he prevents him from drawing
by fixing upon another, under pretence of his
having a more sagacious look. When the handkerchief
is torn, and carefully folded up, it is put
under a glass upon a table placed near a partition.
On that part of the table on which the handkerchief
is deposited, is a little trap, which opens and
lets it fall into a drawer. The confederate, concealed
behind the curtain, passes his hand under
the table, opens the trap, and substitutes the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
handkerchief for the first. He then shuts the trap,
which so exactly fits the hole it closes, as to deceive
the eyes of the most incredulous. If the performer
be not possessed of such a table, he must
have a second handkerchief in his pocket, and
change it by sleight of hand.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Canary in the Egg.</span></h3>

<p>Separate an egg in the middle, as neatly as possible;
empty it, and then with a fine piece of paper
and a little glue, join the two halves together,
having first put a live canary bird inside it, which
will continue unhurt in it for sometime, provided
you make a small pin-hole in the shell to supply
the bird with air; have also, a whole egg in readiness.
Present the two eggs for one to be chosen;
put the egg, which contains the bird, next to the
person who is to choose, and, for this purpose, be
sure to select a lady; she naturally chooses the
nearest to her, because, having no idea of the trick
to be performed, there is no apparent reason to
take the further one at any rate, if the wrong one
be taken, you do not fail in the trick, for you break
the egg, and say: “You see that this egg is fair
and fresh, madam, so you would have found the
other, if you had chosen it. Now, do you choose
to find in it a mouse, or a canary-bird?” She naturally
declares for the bird; nevertheless, if she
ask for the mouse, there are means to escape: you
ask the same question of several ladies, and gather
the majority of votes, which, in all probability,
will be in favor of the bird, which you then
produce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Money Box Trick.</span></h3>

<p>A piece of money, or a ring, is put into a box,
in the presence of a person who holds it; the operator
stands at a distance, and bids him shake the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
box gently, and the piece is heard to rattle inside;
he is desired again to shake it, and then it is not
heard to rattle; the third time, it is again heard,
but the fourth time it is gone, and is found in the
shoe of one of the company. The box must be
made on purpose, in such a manner that, in shaking
it gently up and down, the piece within is
heard; on the contrary, shaking it hard, horizontally,
a little spring, which falls on the piece, prevents
it from being heard, which makes you
imagine it is not within. He who performs the
trick, then touches the box, under pretence of
showing how to shake it, and, although it is locked,
he easily gets out the piece by means of a secret
opening, availing himself of that minute to put in
a false piece, and to leave the box with the same
person, whom he causes to believe that the piece
is or is not within, according to the manner the
box is shaken: at length, the original piece is
found in the shoe of one of the company, either
by means of the person being found in confederacy,
and having a similar piece, or by sending
another to slip it on the floor. In this last case, it
is found on the floor, and the person fixed on is
persuaded that it fell from his shoe as he was
taking it off.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Startling Metamorphosis.</span></h3>

<p>Take a few nut-galls, bruise them to a very fine
powder, which strew nicely upon a towel; then
put a little brown copperas into a basin of water;
this will soon dissolve, and leave the water perfectly
transparent. After any person has washed
in this water, and wiped with the towel on which
the galls have been strewn, his hands and face
will immediately become black; but, in a few days,
by washing with soap, they will again become
clean. This trick is too mischievous for performance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Volcano Under Water.</span></h3>

<p>Take one ounce of saltpetre; three ounces of
powder; of sulphurvivuix, three ounces; beat,
sift, and mix them well together; fill a pasteboard,
or paper mould, with the composition, and it will
burn under the water till quite spent. Few persons
will believe that this can be done before they have
seen it tried.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Magic Spoon.</span></h3>

<p>Put four ounces of bismuth into a crucible, and
when in a state of complete fusion, throw in two
ounces and a half of lead, and one ounce and a
half of tin; these metals will combine, and form
an alloy fusible in boiling water. Mould the alloy
into bars, and take them to a silversmith to be
made into tea-spoons. Place one of them in a
saucer, at a tea-table, and the person who uses it
will not be a little astonished to find it melt away
as soon as he puts it into the hot tea.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Magic Dyes.</span></h3>

<p>Dissolve indigo in diluted sulphuric acid, and
add to it an equal quantity of solution of carbonate
of potass. If a piece of white cloth be dipped in
this mixture, it will be changed to blue; yellow
cloth, in the same mixture, may be changed to
green; red to purple; and blue litmus paper be
turned to red.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Incombustible Paper.</span></h3>

<p>Dip a sheet of paper in strong alum-water, and
when dry, repeat the process; it will be better
still, if you dip and dry it a third time. After this,
you may put it in the flame of a candle, and it will
not burn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Visible and Invisible Portraits.</span></h3>

<p>These are performed with French chalk, a natural
production of the earth, (sold in most oil-shops,)
of a greasy, but extraordinary nature. It
is made use of to draw portraits upon looking-glasses;
which may be made visible and invisible,
alternately, by breathing on and wiping off, and
they will so continue for many months. The lines
will appear very distinct where the glass is strongly
breathed on, and disappear entirely when it is
wiped dry again.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Dancing Egg.</span></h3>

<p>Boil an egg hard, and peel off a small piece of the
shell at one end; then thrust in a quill filled with
quicksilver, and sealed at each end. As long as
the egg remains warm, it will not cease to dance
about.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Put an Egg in a Bottle.</span></h3>

<p>You may make an egg enter a bottle without
breaking, by steeping it in strong vinegar for
some time; the vinegar will so soften the shell, that
it will bend and extend lengthways without breaking;
when put in cold water, it will resume its
former figure and hardness.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Ice Candle.</span></h3>

<p>Cover a small portion of the upper end of a tallow
candle with paper, and give the remainder of it a
coat of fine coal and powdered sulphur, mixed
together; dip it in water, and expose it to the air
during a hard frost, and a slight coat of ice will
form round it, which may be, subsequently, rendered
thicker, in proportion to the number of
immersions and exposure to the air which it receives.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
When it arrives at a sufficient consistency,
take off the paper, light the upper end of the candle,
and it will burn freely.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Changing-Colored Ribbon.</span></h3>

<p>Dip a rose-colored ribbon in nitric acid, diluted
with eight or ten parts of water, and as soon as the
color disappears, which it will do in a short time,
take out the ribbon, and put it into a very weak
alkaline solution; the alkali will quickly neutralize
the acid, and the color will then reappear.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Consulting the Oracle.</span></h3>

<p>Some amusement may be obtained among young
people, by writing, with common ink, a variety of
questions, on different bits of paper, and adding a
pertinent reply to each, written with nitro-muriate
of gold. The collection is suffered to dry, and put
aside until an opportunity offers for using them.
When produced, the answers will be invisible; you
desire different persons to select such questions as
they may fancy, and take them home with them;
you then promise, that if they are placed near the
fire, during the night, answers will appear written
beneath the questions in the morning; and such
will be the fact, if the papers be put in any dry,
warm situation.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Witch’s Cave.</span></h3>

<p>Write several questions and answers on paper;
for the answers, instead of nitro-muriate of gold,
you may use the juice of a citron, or an onion. Let
any of the questions be chosen by a party, and
placed in a box, which may be called “The Witch’s
Cave.” This box must be furnished with a piece
of hot iron, beneath a false bottom of tin; when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the paper is put in it, the heat will cause the answer
to appear; you then take it out, show it to the
person who made choice of the question, and, as
soon as it is read, put it aside; the answer will
vanish when the paper becomes cold again.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Four Elements.</span></h3>

<p>Take a glass tube, about the thickness of a man’s
finger, and securely seal one end of it. Mark it, all
round, with four equal divisions. Introduce mercury,
sufficient to fill the space below the first mark;
a solution of sub-carbonate of potass for the second
division; white spirit, to which a blue tint is imparted,
for the third; and turpentine, colored red,
for the fourth. After these preparations are completed,
close up and seal the mouth of the tube, and
you may then give a fanciful exhibition of chaos
and the four elements. Shake the tube, and you
will mix all the contents together, and this mixture
will represent chaos; in a short time, if the tube
be not removed, all the ingredients will separate,
and each go to its allotted division, placing itself
according to its specific gravity, in comparison with
the others; the contents of the upper division,
which is red, will represent fire; the next, which
has a blue tint, air; the third, which is colorless,
water; and the lower one, earth.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Phosphoric Oyster Shells.</span></h3>

<p>Take some very thick oyster shells, and cover
them with some burning coals; in half an hour
take them carefully out of the fire, and it will be
only necessary to expose them to the light for a few
minutes to be convinced that they have become
phosphorescent. In fact, if put in a dark place,
they shed a light accompanied by the greater part
of the prismatic colors. If the calcination be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
made in a closed crucible, the colors will be less
brilliant. If the crucible be of lead, the parts that
have come into contact with it will yield a reddish
light; if a few bits of steel be strewed about the
crucible, the phosphorescence will be more lively;
but if some flat pieces of coal be used instead of
steel, the colors will be more beautiful, particularly
the blue, red, and green.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Flaming Phosphorus.</span></h3>

<p>By compressing a bit of phosphorus between two
pieces of wood, it will inflame. The same effect
may be produced by the friction of one piece of
phosphorus against another.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Mask of Flame.</span></h3>

<p>Take six parts of oil of olives and one of phosphorus,
suffer them to digest well together, and
preserve the solution, which, in the dark, will become
luminous. An experiment that is considered
amusing may be performed by closing the eyes and
lightly passing a sponge, dipped in this solution,
over the face and hands, which will then, in the
dark, appear covered with a light bluish flame.
This trick is not at all dangerous.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Miniature River on Fire.</span></h3>

<p>Let fall a few drops of phosphorized ether on a
lump of loaf sugar, place the sugar in a glass of
warm water, and a very beautiful appearance will
be instantly exhibited; the effect will be increased,
if the surface of the water, by blowing gently with
the breath, be made to undulate.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Illuminator and Extinguisher.</span></h3>

<p>Make two little figures of wood or clay, or other
materials, with a little hole in the mouth of each.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
Put in the mouth of one, a few grains of bruised
gunpowder, and a little bit of phosphorus in the
other. Then take a lighted wax candle, and present
it to the mouth of the figure with the gunpowder,
which, taking fire, will put the candle out; then
present your candle, having the snuff quite hot, to
the other figure, and it will light again immediately.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Light a Candle by a Glass of Water.</span></h3>

<p>Take a little piece of phosphorus, of the size of
a pin’s head, and with a piece of tallow, stick it on
the edge of a drinking-glass. Then take a lighted
candle, and having blown it out, apply it to the
glass, when it will immediately be lighted. You
may likewise write, with a bit of phosphorus, on
paper, some words, which will appear awful, when
the candle is withdrawn from the room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>



<h3>PUNCH AND JUDY.</h3>


<p>This famous puppet-show can easily be arranged
for the parlor. The first requirement of the performance
will naturally be the <i>dramatis personæ</i>.
These, in the drama as usually played, are as
follows:—</p>

<p>1. Punch. 2. Judy. 3. The Baby. 4. The Dog
Toby. 5. The Clown. 6. The Policeman (or
Beadle). 7. The Hangman. 8. The Doctor. 9. The
Ghost. The head for each character must be carved
out of wood, with a tubular cavity in the neck
large enough to admit the first joint of the performer’s
forefinger. Wooden arms and legs must
next be prepared. These need only extend to the
elbow and knee, and the Baby will require arms
only. Appropriate costumes must next be manufactured.
Mr. Punch will have the usual conical
hat, and Judy a frilled cap and black ribbons. The
body of each figure is a mere bag, just large enough
to admit, through an opening behind, the hand of
the performer, whose forefinger is thrust into the
hollow of the neck, and the thumb and second finger
into the sleeves, thereby giving motion to the
arms.</p>

<p>The robes of the various characters are firmly attached
to the respective heads, and the arms glued
just within the lower part of the sleeves. By slipping
his hand, therefore within the robe, his forefinger
being inserted into the hole in the neck, and his
thumb and middle finger into the sleeves, as above
mentioned, the performer not only keeps the robe
properly distended, but is able to impart the requisite
appearance of vitality to the figures.</p>

<p>Having described the characters, it next becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
necessary to say a few words as to the “stage”
whereon they perform. Most of our readers will
be familiar with the portable theatre of the genuine
street artists; a sentry-box-like wooden framework
with a green baize cover, within which the performer
stands, while a movable shelf in front of
him supports the box which contains the puppets
and other “properties” of the mimic drama. A
little simple stage-carpentering will transform the
domestic clothes-horse into a capital Punch-and-Judy
theatre. Some sort of ornamental framework
or border should be tacked all round the outer
edge of the opening, by way of a kind of proscenium,
and a slip of thin board, three or four inches
in width, should be nailed horizontally across from
side to side, to form the stage. The remainder
should be covered with green baize, tammy, or
any other available material, reaching to the
ground. The structure should be placed against
a wall or window curtain, which will close its
vacant side, and form a convenient background.</p>

<p>Where even this simple arrangement is deemed
too elaborate, an open door, with a slip of wood
tacked across it about six feet from the floor, and a
table cover hanging from this by way of curtain,
will serve as a tolerable makeshift.</p>

<p>The “properties” of the drama are not numerous.
They consist of a gallows or gibbet, made
to fit, when in use, into a mortice cut into the piece
of wood which forms the stage, a couple of wooden
sticks, about a foot in length and half an inch in
diameter, and an instrument known as the
“squeaker,” which is said to be used to produce
those peculiar vocal effects in which Mr. Punch
delights. It consists of a couple of pieces of tin,
each about an inch and a quarter in length, and
three quarters in breadth. These, which are
slightly curved in the direction of their length, are
laid one against the other (the concave faces inward),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
with a piece of tape or China ribbon, of the
same breadth, stretched tightly between them, and
the whole bound firmly together with thread. This
instrument is placed in the mouth, and is asserted
to produce the Root-i-too-ti-too! and other eccentricities
of the Punch language, and it is possible
that in the hands (or rather the mouths) of those
who cultivate the art professionally, it really does
so. We must confess, however, that our own attempts
in that direction have not been successful,
and after several very narrow escapes of swallowing
the instrument, we have come to the conclusion
that a less perfect Root-i-too, produced by natural
means, is on the whole to be preferred. Should
any reader, after this warning, still be disposed to
run the risk of choking himself in the pursuit of
artistic effect, far be it from us to discourage his
noble ardor.</p>

<p>It is customary to have a second or assistant
showman, who stands outside the theatre, and
forms the orchestra, for which purpose he is supplied
with a set of Pandean pipes and a drum, or,
for lack of these, with the best substitutes available.
In a drawing-room, some obliging young
lady at the piano-forte will generally render the
performance independent of his musical aid. But he
has a second function somewhat akin to that of the
“Chorus” of a Greek play. His duty is to converse
with Mr. Punch, to “draw him out,” to elicit his
views on things in general, and his own domestic
arrangements in particular, and last, but not
least, by judicious repetition, in the form of questions
or otherwise, to translate, so to speak, his
observations to the audience.</p>

<p>The drama of Punch and Judy is based on tradition.
The plot is pretty much the same in all
cases, but the dialogue varies according to the taste
and invention of the individual performer. We
subjoin a specimen, representing pretty nearly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
popular version, on which the reader may engraft
such variations as he pleases.</p>

<p>Punch (heard below).—Roo-it-oot-i-too-it!</p>

<p>Showman.—Good morning, Mr. Punch.</p>

<p>Punch.—Good morning, Mr. Showman. Have
you seen my Judy?</p>

<p>Showman.—Have I seen your Judy? No, sir, I
don’t know the lady.</p>

<p>Punch.—She’s such a beauty! I’ll call her. Judy,
my dear! Judy!</p>

<div class="center">
Enter Judy.<br />
</div>

<p>Judy.—Well, Mr. Punch, what do you want!</p>

<p>Punch.—Why, I want to give you a kiss, to be
sure. (They embrace, then dance.)</p>

<p>Punch.—Now Judy, my dear, go and fetch the
baby. (Exit Judy.) Such a beautiful baby! Just
like me!</p>

<p>Showman.—Just like you, is he? Then he <i>must</i>
be a beauty!</p>

<p>Punch.—Oh, here he is! Dance a bady-diddy!</p>

<p>(Judy appears with baby, which she hands to Punch,
and exit.)</p>

<p>Punch.—There’s a little popsy-wopsy! (Nurses
baby and sings),</p>

<p>Punch.—But I never was tried and condemned.</p>

<p>Hangman.—Never mind! We’ll hang you first
and try you afterward.</p>

<p>Punch.—Hanged? Oh, dear! oh, dear!</p>

<p>Hangman.—Yes; and I hope it will be a lesson to
you. (Erects the gallows on the stage.)</p>

<p>Punch.—Oh, my poor wife and sixteen small
children! most of them twins, and the oldest only
three years of age.</p>

<p>Hangman.—Now, Mr. Punch, you are ordered for
instant execution.</p>

<p>Punch.—What’s that?</p>

<p>Hangman.—You are to be hanged by the neck till
you are dead! dead! dead!</p>

<p>Punch.—What! three times?</p>

<p>Hangman.—No; once will be enough. Place your
head in the centre of this noose.</p>

<p>Punch.—Stop a bit; I haven’t made my will.</p>

<p>Hangman.—We can’t help that. Come, put your
head in.</p>

<p>Punch (putting his head one side of the noose).—Where?
There?</p>

<p>Hangman.—No; higher up.</p>

<p>Punch (putting his head over).—There?</p>

<p>Hangman.—No; lower down.</p>

<p>Punch.—Well, I never was hanged before, so how
should I know how it’s done?</p>

<p>Hangman.—I suppose I must show you the way.
Now, then, keep your eye on me. I put my head
in the noose—so! (Puts his head in the noose.)</p>

<p>Punch.—Oh, like that, is it? (Pulls the rope
tightly, and hangs the hangman.) Oee! oee! oee!
I understand all about it. Root-to-too-it! Here’s
a man tumbled into a ditch, and hung himself up

<h2>THE “ART” EXHIBITION.</h2>


<p>The elaborate “sell” which goes by this name is
an institution which has only sprung up within the
last three or four years. We have seen it introduced
on two or three occasions at fancy fairs and
charity bazaars, at which it has proved a great
attraction.</p>

<p>A regular printed catalogue is got up, containing
apparently the names of a collection of pictures or
sculpture, each object duly numbered, and with
the name of the artist appended. In some instances
the name of a (supposed) picture is followed
by an appropriate quotation in poetry or prose,
after the orthodox fashion of the American Academy
and other galleries. We append, by way of
illustration, a selection from the catalogue of a
collection which has met with great success:</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Explanation.</span></h3>

<p>Any one not in the secret perusing the above
catalogue would naturally conclude that the
descriptions referred to pictorial art of some kind
or other. But such is by no means the case. The
visitor, on being admitted, finds, in place of the
expected pictures, shelves or tables on which are
arranged sundry very commonplace objects, each
bearing a numbered ticket. On close examination
he finds that the numbers correspond with those in
the catalogue, and that No. 1, “Horse Fair” (<i>Fare</i>),
is represented, after a realistic fashion, by a handful
of oats and a wisp of hay. No. 2, which he
expected to find a spirited marine sketch, is in
reality only a tooth-brush lying beside a jack-plane;
while the supposed companion picture,
“Caught in a Squall off Yarmouth,” is represented
by a red herring. No. 4, “The Last of Poor Dog
Tray,” is a sausage, and the exhibitor particularly
begs that no gentleman will on any account whistle
while passing this picture. No. 5, “He will return,
I know he will,” presumably the agonized
cry of a forsaken maiden, is in reality a poor-rate
collector’s paper, marked “Fifth application.”
No. 6 is represented by a numbered ticket only,
with no object attached to it. The exhibitor
explains that “The Midnight Hour” has not yet
arrived, but that any gentleman who likes to wait
till it does (which will be at twelve o’clock punctually)
is very welcome to do so. The “Heroes of
Waterloo,” Wellington and Blucher, No. 7, are
represented by a couple of the boots known by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
those distinguished names. 8, “True to the Core,”
is a rosy-cheeked apple. 9 is a coil of watch-spring.
10, “Tears, Idle Tears,” on which the exhibitor
feelingly expatiates as a noble example of the imaginative
in art, is—an onion! The space dedicated
to No. 11 is occupied by the numbered ticket
only, the exhibitor explaining that “The Midnight
Assassin” (who is stated to be a large and lively
<i>flea</i>) has strolled away, and is wandering at large
about the room; and he adds an entreaty that any
lady or gentleman who may meet with him will
immediately return him to his place in the collection.
“The Dripping Well” (No. 12) proves to
be of the description more usually known as a
dripping-<i>pan</i>. “Family Jars,” by Potter, is found
to consist of a pickle-jar and jam-pot. No. 14,
“Never Too Late to Mend,” is a boot patched all
over; while 15, “Past Healing,” is its fellow, too
far gone to admit of like renovation. “The First
Sorrow” is a broken doll. “Saved” is a money-box,
containing twopence-halfpenny, mostly in
farthings. The next is a vacant space, over which
the exhibitor passes with the casual remark, “No.
18, as you will observe, is unfortunately <i>Lost</i>.”
No. 19, “First Love,” is a piece of taffy. 20,
“The Death of the Camel,” is a straw, labeled
“The last,” and the exhibitor explains that this is
<i>the</i> identical straw that broke the camel’s back.
“His First Cigar” is a mild Havana of brown
paper. “A Good Fellow Gone” is suggested,
rather than represented, by an odd glove. Nos.
23, 24 are represented by two small mirrors, which
are handed to a lady and a gentleman respectively,
with a few appropriate remarks as to the extreme
success of the likenesses, coupled with critical remarks
as to the “expression” in each case. “Our
Churchwardens” are a pair of long clay pipes.
No. 26, “Portraits of the Reigning Sovereigns of
Europe,” are represented by a few cancelled foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
postage stamps. “The Monsters of the Deep,”
in No. 27, are represented by a periwinkle and a
shrimp. “The Last Man” (No. 28) is at present
missing from his place in the collection, but the
exhibitor explains that he will be seen going out
just as the exhibition closes. The “Contribution
from the Sheepshanks Collection” (29) is a couple
of mutton-bones; while “The Light of Other Days”
(30) is an old-fashioned lantern and tinder-box.
“The Meet (<i>meat</i>) of Her Majesty’s Hounds” is a
piece of dog-biscuit. No. 32 is a leaky can of
water. “The Maiden’s Joy” (obviously) is a wedding-ring.
“The Fall” is a lady’s veil. No. 35,
“Motherhood,” is the gem of the collection, and
should be kept carefully hidden (say by a handkerchief
thrown over it) until the company have had
time to read and appreciate Mr. Calverley’s graceful
lines, when the veil is removed, and behold—an
egg! No. 36, “A Friendly Party on Hampstead
Heath,” is represented by three toy donkeys.
“Borrowed Plumes” are represented by a lady’s
false front. “Out for the Night” is an extinguished
candle. “Something to Adore” is a rusty
bolt. “The Wearied Grinder” is a back tooth of
somebody’s, very much the worse for wear. “Repentance”
(No. 41) is represented by a smashed
hat and a bottle of soda-water. “Maggie’s Secret”
is a gray hair, labeled “Her first.” No. 43,
“Somebody’s Luggage,” consists of a broken comb
and a paper collar. “Eusebius” is a pair of spectacles.
“Happy Childhood” is indicated by a
lithe and “swishy” cane. When the company
arrive at No. 46, the corresponding object is apparently
missing. The exhibitor refers to his notes,
and says, “46—46? I see they have written down
against No. 46, ‘The Exhibitor,’ but I don’t see
quite what they mean. Suppose we pass on to the
curiosities, ladies and gentlemen.” No. 47 is
merely some smashed crockery, and No. 48 a pewter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
quart-pot. No. 49 is again a vacant space, and the
exhibitor explains that ‘The Last of the Mohicans’
has just gone home to his tea, and has taken his
skull with him. No. 50 is, as its name implies, a
group of marbles (of the school-boy character).
No. 51 is a paper bag of peas, and, being too full,
has “bust.” “The Puzzle” (No. 52) is an old
Guide-book. “The Instantaneous Kid Reviver”
is a baby’s feeding-bottle; and “The Earnest Entreaty”
is the request of the exhibitor that the
visitors will recommend the collection to their
friends.</p>

<p>If the “showman” be possessed of a good fund
of talk and a dash of dry humor, the fun of the
collection may be still further enhanced by his explanations
and criticism of the various objects.
Poor Artemus Ward’s celebrated lecture is an
excellent model to copy; indeed, many of his
“bits” may be stolen bodily with very satisfactory
result. Even without the aid of a showman, the
comparison of the poetical descriptions and the
sober reality will produce a good deal of fun; but,
in this case, the various <i>blanks</i> or vacant spaces to
be filled up by explanation must necessarily be
omitted—a good many telling items being thereby
sacrificed.</p>

<h2>CONJURING WITH COIN.</h2>


<p>Coin-conjuring, like card-conjuring, has its own
peculiar sleights, which it will be necessary for the
student to practice diligently before he can hope to
attain much success in this direction.</p>

<p>The first faculty which the novice must seek to
acquire is that of “palming”—<i>i. e.</i>, secretly holding
an object in the open hand by the contraction
of the palm. To acquire this power, take a half-crown,
florin, or quarter (these being the most convenient
in point of size), and lay it on the palm of
the open hand. Now close the hand very slightly,
and if you have placed the coin on the right spot
(which a few trials will quickly indicate), the contraction
of the palm around its edges will hold it
securely, and you may move the hand and arm in
any direction without fear of dropping it. You
should next accustom yourself to use the hand and
fingers easily and naturally, while still holding the
coin as described. A very little practice will enable
you to do this. You must bear in mind while
practicing always to keep the inside of the palm
either downward or toward your own body, as any
reverse movement would expose the concealed
coin.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Passes.</span></h3>

<p>Being thoroughly master of this first lesson, you
may proceed to the study of the various “passes.”
All of the passes have the same object—viz., the
apparent transfer of an article from one hand to the
other, though such article really remains in the
hand which it has apparently just quitted. As the
same movement frequently repeated would cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
suspicion, and possibly detection, it is desirable to
acquire different ways of effecting this object. It
should be here mentioned that the term “palming,”
which we have so far used as meaning simply
the act of <i>holding</i> any article, is also employed to
signify the act of <i>placing</i> any article in the palm
by one or other of the various passes. The context
will readily indicate in which of the two senses the
term is used in any given passage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pass 1.</span>—Take the coin in the right hand, between
the second and third fingers and the thumb, letting
it, however, really be supported by the fingers, and
only steadied by the thumb. Now move the thumb
out of the way, and close the second and third
fingers, with the coin balanced on them, into the
palm. If the coin was rightly placed in the first
instance, you will find that this motion puts it
precisely in the position above described as the
proper one for palming; and on again extending
the fingers, the coin is left palmed. When you can
do this easily with the hand at rest, you must
practice doing the same thing with the right hand
in motion toward the left, which should meet it
open, but should close the moment that the fingers
of the right hand touch its palm, as though upon
the coin which you have by this movement feigned
to transfer to it. The left hand must thenceforward
remain closed, as if holding the coin, and the right
hand hang loosely open, as if empty.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Palming.</span></h3>

<p>In the motion of “palming” the two hands must
work in harmony, as in the genuine act of passing
an article from the one hand to the other. The left
hand must therefore rise to meet the right, but
should not begin its journey until the right hand
begins its own. Nothing looks more awkward or
unnatural than to see the left hand extended, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
open palm, before the right hand has begun to
move toward it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pass 2.</span>—This is somewhat easier than Pass 1, and
may sometimes be usefully substituted for it. Take
the coin edgeways between the first and third
fingers of the right hand, the sides of those fingers
pressing against the edges of the coin, and the
middle finger steadying it from behind. Carry the
right hand toward the left, and at the same time
move the thumb swiftly over the face of the coin
till the top joint passes its outer edge, then bend
the thumb, and the coin will be found to be securely
nipped between that joint and the junction
of the thumb with the hand. As in the last case,
the left hand must be closed the moment the right
hand touches it; and the right must thenceforth
be held with the thumb bent slightly inward
toward the palm, so that the coin may be shielded
from the view of the spectators. This is an especially
quick mode of palming, and if properly executed
the illusion is perfect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pass 3.</span>—Hold the left hand palm upward, with
the coin in position. Move the right hand toward
the left, and let the fingers simulate the motion of
picking up the coin, and instantly close. At the
same moment slightly close the left hand, so as to
contract the palm around the coin, and drop the
hand, letting it hang loosely by your side.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Vanishing Trick.</span></h3>

<p>A word of caution may here be desirable. These
“passes” must by no means be regarded as being
themselves <i>tricks</i>, but only as processes to be used
in the performance of tricks. If the operator, after
pretending to pass the coin, say, from the right
hand to the left, and showing that it had vanished
from the left hand, were to allow his audience to
discover that it had all along remained in his right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
hand, they might admire the dexterity with which
he had in this instance deceived their eyes, but
they would henceforth guess half the secret of any
trick in which palming was employed. If it is
necessary immediately to reproduce the coin, the
performer should do so by appearing to find it in
the hair or whiskers of a spectator, or in any other
place that may suit his purpose, remembering always
to indicate beforehand that it has passed to
such a place, thereby diverting the general attention
from himself. As the coin is already in his
hand, he has only to drop it to his finger-tips as the
hand reaches the place he has named, in order, to
all appearance, to take it from thence.</p>

<p>The various passes may be employed not only to
cause the disappearance of an article, as above described,
but to secretly exchange it for a substitute
of similar appearance. These exchanges are of
continual use in conjuring; indeed, we may almost
say that three parts of its marvels depend on them.
Such an exchange having been made, the substitute
is left in sight of the audience, while the performer,
having thus secretly gained possession of the
original, disposes of it as may be necessary for the
purpose of the trick.</p>

<p>With this brief practical introduction, we proceed
to describe a few of the simpler tricks with coins.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Heads or Tails.</span></h3>

<p>You borrow a quarter, and spin it, or invite some
other person to spin it, on the table (which must
be without a cloth). You allow it to spin itself
out, and immediately announce, without seeing it,
whether it has fallen head or tail upward. This
may be repeated any number of times with the
same result, though you may be blindfolded, and
placed at the further end of the apartment.</p>

<p>The secret lies in the use of a quarter of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
own, on one face of which (say on the “tail” side)
you have cut at the extreme edge a little notch,
thereby causing a minute point or tooth of metal
to project from that side of the coin. If a coin so
prepared be spun on the table, and should chance
to go down with the notched side upward, it will
run down like an ordinary coin, with a long continuous
“whirr,” the sound growing fainter and
fainter till it finally ceases; but if it should run
down with the notched side downward, the friction
of the point against the table will reduce this
final whirr to half its ordinary length, and the coin
will finally go down with a sort of “flop.” The
difference of sound is not sufficiently marked to
attract the notice of the spectators, but is perfectly
distinguishable by an attentive ear. If, therefore,
you have notched the coin on the “tail” side, and
it runs down slowly, you will cry “tail;” if
quickly, “head.”</p>

<p>If you professedly use a borrowed coin, you must
adroitly change it for your own, under pretence of
showing how to spin it, or the like.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Odd or Even; or, the Mysterious Addition.</span></h3>

<p>You take a handful of coins, and invite another
person to do the same, and to ascertain privately
whether the number he has taken is odd or even.
You request the company to observe that you have
not asked him a single question, but that you are
able, notwithstanding, to divine and counteract his
most secret intentions, and that you will, in proof
of this, yourself take a number of coins and add
them to those he has taken, when, if his number
was odd, the total shall be even; if his number
was even, the total shall be odd. Requesting him
to drop the coins he holds into a hat, held on high
by one of the company, you drop in a certain
number on your own account. He is now asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
whether his number was odd or even; and, the
coins being counted, the total number proves to be,
as you stated, exactly the reverse. The experiment
is tried again and again, with different numbers,
but the result is the same.</p>

<p>The secret lies in the simple arithmetical fact,
that if you add an odd number to an even number,
the result will be <i>odd</i>; if you add an odd number
to an odd number, the result will be <i>even</i>. You
have only to take care, therefore, that the number
you yourself add, whether large or small, shall
always be odd.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Rub One Dime Into Three.</span></h3>

<p>This is a simple little parlor trick, but will sometimes
occasion a good deal of wonderment. Procure
three dimes of the same issue, and privately
stick two of them with wax to the under side of a
table, at about half an inch from the edge, and
eight or ten inches apart. Announce to the company
that you are about to teach them how to make
money. Turn up your sleeves, and take the
third dime in your right hand, drawing particular
attention to its date and general appearance, and
indirectly to the fact that you have no other coin
concealed in your hands. Turning back the table-cover,
rub the dime with the ball of the thumb
backward and forward on the edge of the table.
In this position your fingers will naturally be below
the edge. After rubbing for a few seconds, say,
“It is nearly done, for the dime is getting hot;”
and, after rubbing a moment or two longer with
increased rapidity, draw the hand away sharply,
bringing away with it one of the concealed dimes,
which you exhibit as produced by the friction.
Leaving the waxed dime on the table, and again
showing that you have but one coin in your hands,
repeat the operation with the remaining dime.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Capital Q.</span></h3>

<p>Take a number of coins, say from five-and-twenty
to thirty, and arrange them in the form of
the letter Q, making the “tail” consist of some
six or seven coins. Then invite some person (during
your absence from the room) to count any
number he pleases, beginning at the tip of the tail
and traveling up the <i>left</i> side of the circle, touching
each coin as he does so; then to work back
again from the coin at which he stops (calling such
coin <i>one</i>), this time, however, not returning down
the tail, but continuing round the opposite side of
the circle to the same number. During this process
you retire, but on your return you indicate
with unerring accuracy the coin at which he left
off. In order to show (apparently) that the trick
does not depend on any arithmetical principle, you
reconstruct the Q, or invite the spectators to do so,
with a different number of coins, but the result is
the same.</p>

<p>The solution lies in the fact that the coin at
which the spectator ends will necessarily be <i>at the
same distance from the root of the tail as there are
coins in the tail itself</i>. Thus, suppose that there
are five coins in the tail, and that the spectator
makes up his mind to count eleven. He commences
from the tip of the tail, and counts up the
left side of the circle. This brings him to the sixth
coin beyond the tail. He then retrogrades, and
calling that coin “one,” counts eleven in the opposite
direction. This necessarily brings him to
the fifth coin from the tail on the opposite side,
being the length of the tail over and above those
coins which are common to both processes. If he
chooses ten, twelve, or any other number, he will
still, in counting back again, end at the same
point.</p>

<p>The rearrangement of the coins, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
apparently only intended to make the trick more
surprising, is really designed, by altering the length
of the tail, to shift the position of the terminating
coin. If the trick were performed two or three
times in succession with the same number of coins
in the tail, the spectators could hardly fail to observe
that the <i>same</i> final coin was always indicated,
and thereby to gain a clue to the secret. The
number of coins in the circle itself is quite immaterial.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Wandering Dime.</span></h3>

<p>Have ready two dimes, each slightly waxed on
one side. Borrow a dime, and secretly exchange
it for one of the waxed ones, laying the latter,
waxed side uppermost, on the table. Let any one
draw two squares of ordinary card-board. Take
them in the left hand, and, transferring them to
the right, press the second waxed dime against the
centre of the undermost, to which it will adhere.
Lay this card (which we will call <i>a</i>) on the table,
about eighteen inches from the dime which is already
there, and cover such dime with the other
card, <i>b</i>. Lift both cards a little way from the table,
to show that the dime is under card <i>a</i>, and that
there is (apparently) nothing under card <i>b</i>. As
you replace them, press lightly on the centre
of card <i>a</i>. You may now make the dime
appear under whichever card you like, remembering
that, if you wish the dime <i>not</i> to adhere, you
must bend the card slightly upward in taking it
from the table; if otherwise, take it up without
bending.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Magic Cover and Vanishing Pennies.</span></h3>

<p>For the purpose of this trick you require half a
dozen cents, of which the centre portion has been
cut out, leaving each a mere rim of metal. Upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
these is placed a complete cent, and the whole are
connected together by a rivet, running through the
whole thickness of the pile. When placed upon
the table, with the complete coin upward, they
have all the appearance of a pile of ordinary
pennies, the slight lateral play allowed by the rivet
aiding the illusion. A little leather cap (shaped
something like a fez, with a little button on the
top, and of such a size as to fit loosely over the pile
of cents), with an ordinary die, such as backgammon
is played with, complete the necessary apparatus.</p>

<p>You begin by drawing attention to your magic
cap and die, and in order to exhibit their mystic
powers, you request the loan of half a dozen cents
(the number must, of course, correspond with that
of your own pile). While they are being collected,
you take the opportunity to slip the little cap over
your prepared pile, which should be placed ready
to hand behind some small object on the table, so
as to be unseen by the spectators. Pressing the
side of the cap, you lift the pile with it, and place
the whole together in full view, in close proximity
to the die. The required cents having been now
collected, you beg all to observe that you place the
leather cap (which the spectators suppose to be
empty) fairly over the die. Taking the genuine
coins in either hand, you pretend, by one or other
of the “passes,” to transfer them to the other.
Holding the hand which is now supposed to contain
the coins immediately above the cap, you
announce that they will at your command pass
under the cap, from which the die will disappear to
make room for them. Saying, “One, two, three!
Pass!” you open your hand, and show that the
coins have vanished; and then, lifting up the cap
by the button, you show the hollow pile, covering
the die and appearing to be the genuine coins.
Once more covering the pile with the cap, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
announce that you will again extract the coins, and
replace the die; and to make the trick still more
extraordinary, you will this time pass the coins
right through the table. Placing the hand which
holds the genuine coins beneath the table, and
once more saying, “One, two, three! Pass!” you
chink the coins, and, bringing them up, place them
on the table. Again picking up the cap, but this
time pressing its sides, you lift up the hollow pile
with it, and disclose the die. Quickly transferring
the cap, without the pile, to the other hand, you
place it on the table, to bear the brunt of examination,
while you get rid of the prepared coins.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Pepper-Box, for Vanishing Money.</span></h3>

<p>This is a small tin box, of the pepper-box or flour-dredger
shape, standing three to four inches high.
The “box” portion (as distinguished from the lid)
is made double, consisting of two tin tubes sliding
the one within the other, the bottom being soldered
to the inner one only. By pulling the bottom
downward, therefore, you draw down with it the
inner tube, telescope fashion. By so doing you
bring into view a slit or opening at one side of the
inner tube, level with the bottom, and of such a
size as to let a half-dollar pass through it easily.
The lid is also specially prepared. It has an inner
or false top, and between the true and false top a
loose bit of tin is introduced, which rattles when
the box is shaken, unless you at the same time
press a little point of wire projecting from one of
the holes at the top, and so render it, for the time
being, silent. The box is first exhibited with the
inner tube pushed up into its place, and the
opening thereby concealed. A marked coin is
borrowed, but either before or after the coin is
placed therein, as may best suit his purpose, the
performer secretly draws out the inner tube a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
quarter of an inch or so, thus allowing the coin to
slip through into his hand. As he places the box
on the table, a very slight pressure suffices to force
the tube up again into its original position, and
close the opening. Having made the necessary
disposition of the coin, the performer takes up the
box and shakes it, to show (apparently) that the
coin is still there, pressing on the little point above
mentioned when he desires it to appear that it has
departed, and immediately opening the box to
show that it is empty. The pepper-box will not
bear minute inspection, and is in this particular
inferior to the rattle box.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Nest of Boxes.</span></h3>

<p>This consists of half a dozen circular wooden
boxes, one within the other, the outer box having
much the appearance, but being nearly double the
size, of an ordinary tooth-powder box, and the
smallest being just large enough to contain a quarter.
The series is so accurately made that, by arranging
the boxes in due order, one within the other, and
the lids in like manner, you may, by simply putting
on all the lids together, close all the boxes at
once, though they can only be opened one by one.</p>

<p>These are placed, the boxes together and the lids
together, anywhere so as to be just out of sight of
the audience. If on your table, they may be hidden
by any more bulky article. Having secretly
obtained possession, by either of the means before
described, of a coin which is ostensibly deposited in
some other piece of apparatus, you seize your
opportunity to drop it into the innermost box, and
to put on the united lids. You then bring forward
the nest of boxes (which the spectators naturally
take to be one box only), and announce that the
twenty-five cent piece will at your command pass
from the place in which it has been deposited into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
the box which you hold in your hand, and which
you forthwith deliver to one of the audience for
safe keeping. Touching both articles with the
mystic wand, you invite inspection of the first to
show that the money has departed, and then of the
box, wherein it is to be found. The holder opens
the box, and finds another, and then another, and
in the innermost of all, the marked coin. Seeing
how long the several boxes have taken to open,
the spectators naturally infer that they must take
as long to close, and (apart from the other mysteries
of the trick) are utterly at a loss to imagine how,
with the mere moment of time at your command,
you could have managed to insert the coin, and
close so many boxes. If you desire to use the nest
for a coin larger than a quarter, you can make it
available for that purpose by removing beforehand
the smallest box.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Ball of Berlin Wool.</span></h3>

<p>An easy and effective mode of terminating a
money trick is to pass the marked coin into the
centre of a large ball of Berlin wool or worsted, the
whole of which has to be unwound before the coin
can be reached. The <i>modus operandi</i>, though perplexing
to the uninitiated, is absurdly simple when
the secret is revealed. The only apparatus necessary
over and above the wool (of which you must
have enough for a good-sized ball), is a flat tin tube,
three to four inches in length, and just large
enough to allow a quarter or half-dollar (whichever
you intend to use for the trick) to slip through it
easily. You prepare for the trick by winding the
wool on one end of the tube, in such manner that
when the whole is wound in a ball, an inch or so
of the tube may project from it. This you place in
your pocket, or anywhere out of sight of the audience.
You commence the trick by requesting some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
one to mark a coin, which you forthwith exchange
by one or other of the means already described, for
a substitute of your own, and leave the latter in
the possession or in view of the spectators, while
you retire to fetch your ball of wool, or simply
take it from your pocket. Before producing it,
you drop the genuine coin down the tube into the
centre of the ball, and withdraw the tube, giving
the ball a squeeze to remove all trace of an opening.
You then bring it forward, and place it in a glass
goblet or tumbler, which you hand to a spectator
to hold. Taking the substitute coin, you announce
that you will make it pass invisibly into the very
centre of the ball of wool, which you accordingly
pretend to do, getting rid of it by means of one or
other of the “passes” already described. You
then request a second spectator to take the loose
end of the wool, and to unwind the ball, which,
when he has done, the coin falls out into the
goblet.</p>

<p>The only drawback to the trick is the tediousness
of unwinding. To obviate this, some performers
use a wheel made for the purpose, which materially
shortens the length of the operation.</p>

<h2>MISCELLANEOUS TRICKS.</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Raisin Tortoise.</span></h3>

<p>This noble animal is constructed as follows:—A
muscatel raisin forms the body, and small portions
of the stalk of the same fruit the head and
legs. With a little judgment in the selection of the
pieces of stalk and the mode in which they are
thrust into the body, it is surprising what a lifelike
tortoise may be thus produced. While the
work of art in question is being handed round on a
plate for admiration, the artist may further distinguish
himself, if the wherewithal is obtainable,
by constructing</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Lemon Pig.</span></h3>

<p>The body of the pig consists of a lemon. The
shape of this fruit renders it particularly well
adapted for this purpose, the crease or shoulder at
the small end of the lemon being just the right
shape to form the head and neck of the pig. With
three or four lemons to choose from, you cannot
fail to find at least one which will answer the purpose
exactly. The mouth and ears are made by
cutting the rind with a penknife, the legs of short
ends of lucifer matches, and the eyes either of black
pins, thrust in up to the head, or of grape-stones.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Seasick Passenger.</span></h3>

<p>The requirements for this touching picture are
an orange, a pocket-handkerchief or soft table-napkin,
and a narrow water goblet. The orange
is first prepared by cutting in the rind with a penknife
the best ears, nose, and mouth which the
artist can compass, a couple of raisin-pips supplying
the place of eyes. A pocket-handkerchief is
stretched lightly over the glass, and the prepared
orange laid thereon. The pocket-handkerchief is
then moved gently backward and forward over
the top of the glass, imparting to the orange a rolling
motion, and affording a laughable but striking
caricature of the agonies of a seasick passenger.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Enchanted Raisins.</span></h3>

<p>Take four raisins or bread-pills, and place them
about a foot apart, so as to form a square on the table.
Next fold a couple of table-napkins, each into a pad
of five inches square. Take one of these in each
hand, the fingers undermost and the thumb uppermost.
Then inform the company that you are
about to give them a lesson in the art of hanky-panky,
etc., and in the course of your remarks
bring down the two napkins carelessly over
the two raisins farthest from you. Leave the right-hand
napkin on the table, but, in withdrawing the
hand, bring away the raisin between the second
and third fingers, and at the same moment remarking,
“You must watch particularly how many
raisins I place under each napkin,” lift the left-hand
napkin (as if merely to show that there is one
raisin only beneath it), and transfer it to the palm
of the outstretched right hand, behind which the
raisin is now concealed. Without any perceptible
pause, but at the same time without any appearance
of haste, you replace the folded napkin on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
raisin No. 2, and in so doing leave raisin No. 1 beside
it. Now take up raisin No 3 (with the right
hand). Put the hand under the table, and in
doing so get raisin No. 3 between the second and
third fingers, as much <i>behind</i> the hand as possible.
Give a rap with the knuckles on the under-side of
the table, at the same time saying, “Pass!” and
forthwith pick up the left-hand napkin with the
left hand, showing the raisins 1 and 2 beneath it.
All eyes are drawn to the two raisins on the table,
and as the right hand comes into sight from beneath
the table the left quietly transfers the napkin
to it, thereby effectually concealing the presence
of raisin No. 3. The napkin is again laid over
raisins 1 and 2, and No. 3 is secretly deposited with
them. No. 4 is then taken in the right hand, and
the process repeated, when <i>three</i> raisins are naturally
discovered; the napkin being once more replaced,
and No. 4 left with the rest. There are
now four raisins under the left-hand napkin, and
none under that on the right hand, though the
spectators are persuaded that there is <i>one</i> under
the latter, and only <i>three</i> under the former. The
trick being now practically over, the performer
may please himself as to the form of the <i>dénouement</i>
and, having gone through any appropriate form of
incantation, commands the imaginary <i>one</i> to go
and join the other three, which is found to have
taken place accordingly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Demon Lump of Sugar.</span></h3>

<p>The performer commences by borrowing two
hats, which he places, crown upward, upon the
table, drawing particular attention to the fact that
there is nothing whatever under either of them.
He next demands the loan of the family sugar
basin, and requests some one to select from it a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
lump of sugar (preferably one of an unusual and
easily distinguished shape), at the same time informing
them that, by means of a secret process,
only known to himself, he will undertake to swallow
such lump of sugar before their eyes, and yet,
after a few minutes’ interval, bring it under either
of the two hats they may choose. The company,
having been prepared by the last trick to expect
some ingenious piece of sleight-of-hand, are all on
the <i>qui vive</i> to prevent any substitution of another
lump of sugar, or any pretence of swallowing
without actually doing so. However, the performer
does unmistakably take the identical lump
of sugar chosen and crush it to pieces with his
teeth. He then asks, with unabated confidence,
under which of the two hats he shall bring it, and,
the choice having been made, places the chosen
hat on his own head, and in that way fulfills his
undertaking.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Mysterious Production.</span></h3>

<p>This is another feat of the genus “sell,” and to
produce due effect should only be introduced after
the performer has, by virtue of a little genuine
magic, prepared the company to expect from him
something a little out of the common. He begins
by informing the spectators that he is about to
show them a great mystery, a production of nature
on which no human being has ever yet set eye,
and which, when they have once seen, no human
being will ever set eyes on again. When the general
interest is sufficiently awakened, he takes a
nut from the dish and, having gravely cracked it,
exhibits the kernel, and says, “Here is an object
which you will all admit no human being has ever
seen, and which” (here he puts it into his mouth
and gravely swallows it) “I am quite sure nobody
will ever see again.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Family Giant.</span></h3>

<p>A very fair giant, for domestic purposes, may be
produced by the simple expedient of seating a
young lad astride on the shoulders of one of the
older members of the company, and draping the
combined figure with a long cloak or Inverness
cape. The “head” portion may, of course, be
“made up” as much as you please, the more complete
the disguise the more effective being the
giant. A ferocious-looking moustache and whiskers
will greatly add to his appearance. If some
ready-witted and genial member of the party will
undertake to act as showman, and exhibit the
giant, holding a lively conversation with him, and
calling attention to his gigantic idiosyncrasies, a
great deal of fun may be produced. The joke should
not, however, be very long continued, as the
feelings of the “legs” have to be considered. If
too long deprived of air and light they are apt to
wax rebellious, and either carry the giant in directions
he would fain avoid, or even occasionally to
strike altogether, and bring the giant’s days to a
sudden and undignified termination.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Animated Telescope.</span></h3>

<p>This is a much more finished deception, and is not
unfrequently seen exhibited at theatres and circuses.
The figure is constructed as follows:—You
procure a stout broomstick, four feet long, and on
one end thereof fasten firmly a grotesque pasteboard
head, with appropriate headdress. Next
construct an extinguisher-shaped robe of some dark
material (a coarse black muslin or canvas is the
best, as allowing a reasonable amount of light and
ventilation to the performer). It should be gathered
in with a frill round the neck of the figure, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
should be of such a length that when the performer
stands beneath, with the stick extended at full
length above his neck, it shall all but reach the
ground. The robe should taper gradually outward,
from a diameter of about eight inches at the top to
about two feet six at the bottom. A cane hoop
should be fastened horizontally within it at about
the height of the performer’s knees, and another at
about the level of his chin. These keep the
garment distended, and give the operator much
greater freedom of movement than he would otherwise
enjoy. The lower hoop should be attached
by four pieces of tape to a belt around the performer’s
waist, this arrangement keeping it at a
uniform height from the floor, and preventing the
skirt getting under the performer’s feet in walking.</p>

<p>With a little practice the figure thus composed
may be made to go through a variety of the most
eccentric manœuvres. For instance, by gradually
lowering the stick, and at the same time contracting
the body into a crouching position, it may be
made to sink to the dimensions of a dwarf.</p>

<p>By bending the body, and at the same time lowering
the stick into a horizontal position, the figure
will be made to salute. While in this position the
head may be made to describe a circle of three or
four feet in diameter, with inexpressibly comical
effect. The stick may then be sloped backward.
By way of finale, the figure may be made to pass
its head between its legs, and in that position make
its exit. Some little practice is required to work
the “Nondescript” effectively.</p>


<h3>“<span class="smcap">The What-do-you-Think?</span>”</h3>

<p>Our next three or four sections will be devoted
to the description of the after-dinner menagerie.
We will begin with the “What-do-you-Think?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>The exhibitor begins, in proper showman style,
“Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the pleasure of
exhibiting to your notice the celebrated ‘What-do-you-Think?’
or Giant Uncle-Eater. You have all
probably heard of the Ant-Eater. This is, as you
will readily perceive, a member of the same family,
but more so! He measures seven feet from the
tip of his snout to the end of his tail, eight feet
back again, five feet round the small of his waist,
and has four feet of his own, making twenty-four
in all. In his natural state he lives chiefly on blue-bottle
flies and mixed pickles, but in captivity it is
found that so rich a diet has a tendency to make
him stout, and he is now fed exclusively on old
champagne corks and back numbers of some daily
paper. His voice, which you may perhaps have
an opportunity of hearing (here the ‘What-do-you-Think?’
howls dismally), is in the key of B flat,
and is greatly admired. People come here before
breakfast to hear it, and when they have heard it,
they assure us that they never heard anything like
it before. Some have even gone so far as to say
that they never wish to hear anything like it
again.” Etc.</p>

<p>The “What-do-you-Think?” is manufactured as
follows:—The performer, who should have black
kid gloves on, places on his head a conical paper
cap, worked up with the aid of the nursery paint-box
into a rough semblance of an animal’s head.
This being securely fastened on, he goes down on
his hands and knees and a shaggy railway rug (of
fur, if procurable) is thrown over him, and secured
round his neck, when the animal is complete.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Giraffe.</span></h3>

<p>A grotesque head, as nearly approaching the
required shape as possible, is securely fastened to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
the end of a long stick, which is held by the foremost
of the two performers who form the body
beneath. To this head is attached the cloth which
is designed to form the body of the animal, and
which should be pinned round the bodies of the
two performers. A rope tail may be added.</p>

<p>A good deal of fun may be produced by the
efforts of the animal to scratch his head with his
hind leg, etc.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Dwarf.</span></h3>

<p>The Dwarf can scarcely be said to belong to the
menagerie, but may appropriately follow in this
place. He is constructed as follows:—A table, with
cover, is placed just in front of the drawn curtains
of a window. The performers, of whom there are
two, place themselves behind the table, the one in
front of the other. The foremost either stands, or
kneels on a stool, as may be found most convenient,
and rests his hands, which are encased in a pair of
boots, upon the table. These form the feet of the
Dwarf. The second performer stands behind the
first, concealed by the curtain, and passes his arms,
which are the only part of his person in view, over
the shoulders of the first performer, to form the
arms of the dwarf. The above arrangements are,
of course, made before the company are admitted
into the room. The dwarf then proceeds to make
a speech or sing a song, which the arms accompany
with (as a rule) singularly inappropriate gestures.
Thus, at a very impressive portion of (say)
Hamlet’s soliloquy, the right hand will be seen to
tweak the nose violently, or even to “take a sight”
at the assembled company. The arms have even
been known to stop the eloquence of the mouth, by
violently cramming a pocket-handkerchief into it.
The legs are equally eccentric in their behavior,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
the Dwarf not hesitating, on an emergency, to
scratch his nose with his foot, and so on.</p>

<p>The representation of the Dwarf demands a little
practice, but, if it is well worked, the effect produced
will fully repay the trouble expended in
arranging it. A child’s pinafore will be found the
most appropriate garment.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Two Hats.</span></h3>

<p>This is a modern version of the old “Game of
Contraries.” The leader brings forward two hats;
one he places on his own head, and hands the other
to one of the company, with whom he enters into
conversation. The person addressed must stand
when the leader sits, and sit when he stands, take
off his hat when the leader puts on his, and <i>vice
versa</i>. A failure in any of these particulars is punishable
by a forfeit. The conversation may be
somewhat as follows:</p>

<p>Leader (standing and wearing his own hat).
Allow me to offer you a hat, sir. (Sits down.)</p>

<p>Victim (standing up). I am much obliged to
you, but I already have one.</p>

<p>Leader. Scarcely so becoming as this one, I
think. But won’t you try it on? (Stands up, and
victim sits down.) Allow me to place it on your
head.</p>

<p>Victim. Not at present, thank you, though I
quite admit it is a very charming hat.</p>

<p>Leader (throwing himself into a chair, and fanning
himself with his hat). Dear me, how very
hot the room is! Pray don’t rise on my account.
(Victim stands up, but omits to put on his hat,
whereby he incurs a forfeit, and the leader passes
on to endeavor to entrap some other player.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Knight of the Whistle.</span></h3>

<p>This is a capital game for everybody but the victim,
and produces much fun. Some one who does
not know the game is chosen to be Knight of the
Whistle, and is commanded to kneel down and
receive the honor of knighthood, which the leader
(armed with a light cane, the drawing-room poker,
or other substitute for a sword) confers in due
form.</p>

<p>While placing him in position, opportunity is
taken to attach to his back, by means of a bent pin
or otherwise, a piece of string about a foot in
length, to which is attached a small light whistle.
Having been duly dubbed, in order to complete his
dignity, he is informed that he must now go in
quest of the Whistle, which is in the hands of one
of the company, and will be sounded at intervals,
in order to guide him in his search. Meanwhile
the other players gather in a circle round him,
making believe to pass an imaginary object from
hand to hand. The victim naturally believes that
this imaginary object must be the long-lost Whistle,
and makes a dash for it accordingly, when the
player who happens to be behind his back blows
the actual whistle, and instantly drops it again.
Round flies the unhappy Knight, and makes a
fresh dash to seize the Whistle, but in vain. No
sooner has he turned to a fresh quarter than the
ubiquitous Whistle again sounds behind his back.</p>

<p>If the game is played smartly, and care taken not
to <i>pull</i> upon the cord, the Knight may often be
kept revolving for a considerable period before he
discovers the secret.</p>

<p>Sometimes a lady is chosen to “dub” the intended
Knight, and the following piece of doggerel
is repeated, the leader prompting:—</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="play lines">
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">Lady.</td>
<td align="left" valign="top">Why do you kneel thus low to implore?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">Gentleman.&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left" valign="top">That I may remain a mere gent no more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">Lady.</td>
<td align="left" valign="top">How can I help your being a gent?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">Gentleman.</td>
<td align="left" valign="top">Dub me a Knight—you shall not repent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">Lady.</td>
<td align="left" valign="top">If I should yield to your request,<br />What knightly duty will please you best?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">Gentleman.</td>
<td align="left" valign="top">To wait on ladies from morn till night,<br />And meet their foes in deadly fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">Lady.</td>
<td align="left" valign="top">Will you promise to heed all I may say,<br />And my will or whim henceforth to obey?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">Gentleman.</td>
<td align="left" valign="top">Yes, whatever you bid me do<br />Shall be my law—I belong to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">Lady.</td>
<td align="left" valign="top">Go, then, and be no longer blind,<br />And the troublesome Knight of the Whistle find.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>The lady then strikes his shoulder with her fan or
handkerchief, and says, “Rise up, Sir——”</p>

<p>In this case the victim is not told, but is left to
discover that he himself is the Knight of the
Whistle.</p>


<h3>“<span class="smcap">He Can Do Little.</span>”</h3>

<p>This is another “sell” of almost childish simplicity,
but we have seen people desperately puzzled
over it, and even “give it up” in despair.</p>

<p>The leader takes a stick (or poker) in his left
hand, thence transfers it to his right, and thumps
three times on the floor, saying, “He can do little
who can’t do this.” He then hands the stick to
another person, who, as he supposes, goes through
exactly the same performance, but if he does not
know the game, is generally told, to his disgust,
that he has incurred a forfeit, his imitation not
having been exact.</p>

<p>The secret lies in the fact that the stick, when
passed on, is first received in the left hand, and
thence transferred to the right before going through.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>


<h3>“<span class="smcap">Throwing Light.</span>”</h3>

<p>Two of the company agree privately upon a word
(which as before, should be one susceptible of two
or three meanings), and interchange remarks tending
to throw light upon it. The rest of the players
do their best to guess the word, but when either of
them fancies he has succeeded, he does not publicly
announce his guess, but makes such a remark
as to indicate to the two initiated that he has discovered
their secret. If they have any doubt that
he has really guessed the word, they challenge him,
i. e., require him to name it in a whisper. If his
guess proves to be right, he joins in the conversation,
and assists in throwing light on the subject;
but if, on the other hand, he is wrong, he must
submit to have a handkerchief thrown over his
head, and so remain, until by some more fortunate
observation he shall prove that he really possesses
the secret.</p>

<p>We will give an example. Mr. A. and Miss B.
have agreed on “Bed” as the word, and proceed
to throw light upon it; alternating upon its various
meanings of a place of repose, a part of a garden,
or the bed of a river.</p>

<p>Miss B. I don’t know what your opinion may be,
but I am never tired of it.</p>

<p>Mr. A. Well, for my part, I am never in a hurry,
either to get to it or to leave it.</p>

<p>Miss B. How delightful it is after a long tiring
day!</p>

<p>Mr. A. Yes. But it is a pleasure that soon palls.
The most luxurious person does not care for too
much of it at a stretch.</p>

<p>Miss B. Oh! don’t you think so? In early spring
for instance, with the dew upon the flowers!</p>

<p>Mr. A. Ah! you take the romantic view. But
how would you like it beneath some rapid torrent,
or some broad majestic river.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss C. (thinks she sees her way, and hazards a
remark). Or in a <i>souché</i>!</p>

<p>Mr. A. I beg your pardon. Please tell me, in a
whisper, what you suppose the word to be?</p>

<p>Miss C. (whispers). Fish! What! isn’t that
right?</p>

<p>Mr. A. I am afraid you must submit to a temporary
eclipse. (Throws her handkerchief over her
face.)</p>

<p>Mr. A. to Miss B. You mentioned spring, I
think. For my own part, I prefer feathers.</p>

<p>Mr. D. (rashly concludes, from the combination
of “spring” and “feathers,” that spring-chickens
must be referred to). Surely you would have them
plucked?</p>

<p>Mr. A. (looks puzzled). I think not. May I ask
you to name your guess? Oh, no, quite out. I must
trouble you for your pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p>Miss B. It is curious, isn’t it, that they must be
made afresh every day?</p>

<p>Mr. A. So it is; though I confess it never struck
me in that light before. I don’t fancy, however,
that old Brown the gardener makes his quite so
often.</p>

<p>Miss B. You may depend that he has it made for
him, though.</p>

<p>Miss C. (from under the handkerchief). At any
rate, according as he makes it, his fate will be
affected accordingly. You know the proverb?</p>

<p>Mr. A. (removing the handkerchief). You have
fairly earned your release. By the way, do you
remember an old paradox upon this subject, “What
nobody cares to give away, yet nobody wishes to
keep?”</p>

<p>Miss E. Ah! now you have let out the secret. I
certainly don’t wish to keep mine for long together,
but I would willingly give it away if I could get a
better.</p>

<p>Miss B. Tell me your guess. (Miss E. whispers.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Yes, you have hit it. I was afraid Mr. A.’s last
“light” was rather too strong.</p>

<p>And so the game goes on, until every player is in
the secret, or the few who may be still in the dark
“give it up” and plead for mercy. This, however,
is a rare occurrence, for, as the company in general
become acquainted with the secret, the “lights”
are flashed about in a rash and reckless manner, till
the task of guessing becomes almost a matter of
course to an ordinarily acute person.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Multiplying Shadows.</span></h3>

<p>Before quitting the subject of fireside amusements,
we may give a passing mention to the subject
of the curious optical illusion called “The
Multiplying Shadows,” sometimes also known,
from one form in which it is presented, as The
Witches’ Dance. A dummy figure (suppose that of
a witch, riding on the conventional broomstick) is
suspended by fine threads or wires on the side of
the screen remote from the spectators. Behind this
are ranged, one behind the other, and at right
angles to the screen, a row of lighted candles.
Being all in the same line, they throw one shadow
only on the screen. The figure is now made to
oscillate slightly, so as to impart some little motion
to the shadow. One of the candles is now removed
from its place in the row, and waved gently about,
now high, now low, the effect to the spectators
being that a second shadow springs out of the first,
and dances about it on the screen. A second and
third candle is then removed, and waved up and
down, each candle as it leaves its place in the line
producing a separate shadow. It is well to have
three or four assistants, each taking a candle in
each hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Vanishing Knots.</span></h3>

<p>For this trick you must use a silk handkerchief.
Twisting it rope-fashion, and grasping it by the
middle with both hands, you request one of the
spectators to tie the two ends together. He does
so, but you tell him he has not tied them half tight
enough, and you yourself pull them still tighter.
A second and a third knot are made in the same
way, the handkerchief being drawn tighter by yourself
after each knot is made. Finally, taking the
handkerchief, and covering the knots with the
loose part, you hand it to someone to hold. Breathing
on it, you request him to shake out the handkerchief,
when all the knots are found to have disappeared.</p>

<p>When the performer apparently tightens the knot,
he in reality only strains one end of the handkerchief,
grasping it above and below the knot. This
pulls that end of the handkerchief out of its twisted
condition and into a straight line, round which the
other end of the handkerchief remains twisted;
in other words, converts the knot into a slip-knot.
After each successive knot he still straightens this
same end of the handkerchief. This end, being thus
made straight, would naturally be left longer than
the other, which is twisted round and round it.
This tendency the performer counteracts by drawing
it partially back through the slip-knot at each
pretended tightening. When he finally covers over
the knots, which he does with the left hand, he
holds the straightened portion of the handkerchief,
immediately behind the knots, between the first
finger and thumb of the right hand, and therewith,
in the act of covering over the knots, draws this
straightened portion completely out of the slip-knot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Dancing Sailor.</span></h3>

<p>The Dancing Sailor is a figure cut out of cardboard,
eight or nine inches in height, and with its
arms and legs cut out separately, and attached to
the trunk with thread in such a manner as to hang
perfectly free. The mode of exhibiting it is as
follows:—The performer, taking a seat facing the
company, with his legs slightly apart, places the
figure on the ground between them. As might be
expected, it falls flat and lifeless, but after a few
mesmeric passes it is induced to stand upright,
though without visible support, and, on a lively
piece of music being played, dances to it, keeping
time, and ceasing as soon as the music ceases.</p>

<p>The secret lies in the fact that, from leg to leg of
the performer, at about the height of the figure
from the ground, is fixed (generally by means of a
couple of bent pins), a fine black silk thread, of
eighteen or twenty inches in length. This allows
him to move about without any hindrance. On
each side of the head of the figure is a little slanting
cut, tending in a perpendicular direction, and
about half an inch in length. The divided portions
of the cardboard are bent back a little, thus forming
two “hooks,” so to speak, at the sides of the
head. When the performer takes his seat, as before
mentioned, the separation of his legs draws the silk
comparatively taut, though, against a moderately
dark background, it remains wholly invisible.
When he first places the figure on the ground, he
does so simply, and the figure naturally falls. He
makes a few sham mesmeric passes over it, but
still it falls. At the third and fourth attempt, however,
he places it so that the little hooks already
mentioned just catch the thread, and the figure is
thus kept upright. When the music commences, the
smallest motion, or pretence of keeping time with
the feet is enough to start the sailor in a vigorous
hornpipe.</p>

<h2>CONUNDRUMS AND RIDDLES.</h2>


<p>These are by no means of modern origin: the
Sphinx puzzled the brains of some of the heroes
of antiquity, and even Alexander the Great, as it
is written, made several essays to untie the knot
(a practical riddle) with which Gordius, the Phrygian
king, who had been raised from the plow to
the throne, tied up his implements of husbandry
in the temple, in so intricate a manner, that universal
monarchy was promised to the man who
could undo it: after having been repeatedly baffled,
he, at length, drew his sword, considering that he
was entitled to the fulfillment of the promise, by
cutting the Gordian knot.</p>

<h4>1.</h4>

<p>A creature was formerly seen in England, which
has lately been expelled from it, and which has
some very peculiar properties appertaining to it.
It stands upon one leg,—on which, without any
body, is seen a great square head. It has three
eyes, of which the centre is by far the largest; indeed
so much so, that it has before now contained
two more. The head is of a very peculiar construction,
but exactly suited to its design: whenever it
is about to be used, it is separated in halves, and,
when reconnected, is held up to the gaze of an insolent
rabble. All the notice, however, which it
generally attracts, results from its being the effectual
means of exhibiting another to the gaze of a
hostile crowd. Such is this when entire; but when
divided, and cut to pieces, a curious and careful
observer may collect all that follows, by a selection
and appropriate arrangement of its fragments.</p>

<p>A dose of medicine conveyed in a very agreeable
manner, as, however nauseous its ingredients may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
have originally been, it is quite tasteless. Such a
state of the physical powers as requires such a dose.
A part of the face, of a color quite different from
the rest, and the more handsome, the greater the
difference. A public record on which many are
very anxious to get their names entered; or, to
descend from great things to small, a substance that
is devoured every morning for breakfast. A river
which flows through a very delightful and agreeable
part of Europe. What curious people are very
fond of doing. What a candidate, for your vote at
the next general election, if he should think it
worth his while, will demand. A very poetical
portion of the watery element, which murmurs and
meanders in the description of many a poetaster.
A quality of resinous substances. A female nickname.
What is very necessary to be done occasionally
in your shrubbery. An exclamation of
surprise. A flower displaying more to admire than
Solomon in all his glory. To tear. The expressed
juice of olives,—and its adjective. A conjunction.
And two initial letters, whose reiterated sounds
have drowned the voices of strutting monarchs and
ephemeral heroes.</p>

are, in general, the most happy in solving
those of others. The admirers of these frequently
amusing trifles, consider opposition in their component
parts, or curious combinations, to be most
essential in the construction of good riddles.</p>

<h2>CHARADES.</h2>


<p>In some form or other, the game of charades is
played in almost every country under the sun.
The most popular form is as follows:</p>

<p>Send one-half the company out of the room, the
others remaining as audience. Rooms separated
by double doors or portières are best for the scene
of action.</p>

<p>The party outside thinks of some word which
can be represented entire, in pantomime or tableau.
Thus, the door opening, discloses a half
dozen young girls standing in a line, while one
of the acting party announces that this striking
tableau represents the name of a famous orator.
The audience failing to guess, is told that Cicero
(Sissy-row) is the man.</p>

<p>Again just as the clock strikes ten, the doors opening,
reveal a lady eating an apple or any convenient
edible, while a gentleman who stands near, points
to the clock and then at her. This being correctly
guessed to represent “attenuate,” (at ten you ate)
the other side goes from the room and the previous
performers become the audience.</p>

<p>There are a host of words which, with a little
ingenuity and the aid of a dictionary, may be
turned to account. For example:</p>

<p>Ingratiate. (In grey she ate.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>Catering. (Kate. Her ring.)</p>

<p>Hero. (He row.)</p>

<p>Tennessee. (Ten, I see.)</p>

<p>And so on. Clever players will devise new and
amusing combinations in the game.</p>

<p>Charades may be performed after a variety of
different fashions. First is the highly finished
charade, with speech and action carefully prepared
and duly rehearsed. Secondly, the spoken charade,
got up on the spur of the moment, words and
action alike <i>ex tempore</i>. We have seen a good
deal of fun got out of charades of this description;
but unless the actors are of more than average
ability, and have some little dramatic experience,
the chances are much against any very satisfactory
result. On the whole, we should strongly recommend,
that where a charade is got up <i>ex tempore</i>,
it should be acted in pantomime only. It is of
course understood that, whatever be the particular
mode of performance, a charade always represents
a “word” to be guessed, with one scene to each
syllable (or group of consecutive syllables), and a
final scene representing the whole word. The successive
scenes are sometimes wholly independent
of each other, but in the more finished class of
charades are made parts of a complete drama.
The following are good charade words:—</p>


<ul class="words"><li>Knighthood,</li>
<li>Penitent,</li>
<li>Looking-glass,</li>
<li>Hornpipe,</li>
<li>Necklace,</li>
<li>Indolent,</li>
<li>Light-house,</li>
<li>Hamlet,</li>
<li>Pantry,</li>
<li>Phantom,</li>
<li>Windfall,</li>
<li>Infancy,</li>
<li>Snow-ball,</li>
<li>Definite,</li>
<li>Bowstring,</li>
<li>Carpet,</li>
<li>Sunday,</li>
<li>Shylock,</li>
<li>Earwig,</li>
<li>Matrimony,</li>
<li>Cowhiding,</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>Welcome,</li>
<li>Sweepstake,</li>
<li>Sackcloth,</li>
<li>Antidote,</li>
<li>Antimony,</li>
<li>Pearl-powder,</li>
<li>King-fisher,</li>
<li>Football,</li>
<li>Housekeeping,</li>
<li>Friendship,</li>
<li>Horsemanship,</li>
<li>Coltsfoot,</li>
<li>Bridegroom,</li>
<li>Housemaid,</li>
<li>Curl-papers,</li>
<li>Crumpet.</li>
</ul>


<p>It will be obvious that in some of these instances,
as, for instance, “Sweepstake,” “Housekeeping,”
two syllables must be taken together to supply the
<i>motif</i> for a single scene.</p>

<p>We will take the word “Windfall,” as affording
a ready illustration of the pantomime charade, and
be it remembered that, in charades of this description,
the shorter and simpler the action the better.
Thus the scene, “Wind,” may be represented by a
German Band, puffing away at imaginary ophicleides
and trombones, with distended cheeks and
frantic energy, though in perfect silence. The
next scene, “Fall,” may be a party of boys on a
slide, who “keep the pot-a-boiling” for a moment
or two, and then <i>exeunt</i>. Enter an elderly gentleman,
with umbrella up; walks unsuspectingly on
to the slide, and falls. It should be mentioned,
that the expedient adopted in the <i>very</i> early days
of the drama, of putting up a placard to notify,
“This is a street.” “This is the quarter-deck of
the <i>Baltimore</i>,” is quite correct in the case of a
pantomime charade. The complete word, “Windfall,”
may be represented by a young man sitting
alone, leaning his elbows on his hands, and having
every appearance of being in the last stage of impecuniosity.
To produce this effect, he may go
through a pantomime of examining his purse and
showing it empty, searching his pockets, and turning
them one by one inside out, shaking his head
mournfully, and sitting down again, throwing into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
his expression as much despair as he conveniently
can. A letter carrier’s whistle is heard; a servant
enters with a legal-looking letter. The impecunious
hero, tearing it open, produces from it a roll of
bank-notes (these, if a due supply of the genuine
article does not happen to be readily obtainable,
may be of the “Bank of Elegance” description),
and forthwith gives way to demonstrations of the
most extravagant delight, upon which the curtain
falls.</p>

<p>A very absurd, but not the less meritorious,
charade of this class is represented as follows:—The
curtain rises (<i>i. e.</i>, the folding-doors are thrown
open), and a placard is seen denoting, “This is
Madison Square,” or any other place where professional
men most do congregate. Two gentlemen
in out-door costumes cross the stage from
opposite sides, and bow gravely on passing each
other, one of them saying, as they do so, “Good-morning,
doctor.” The curtain falls, and the
audience are informed that the charade, which
represents a word of six syllables, is complete in
that one scene. When the spectators have guessed,
or been told that the word is “met-a-physician,”
the curtain again rises on precisely the same scene,
and the same performance, action for action, and
word for word, is repeated over again. The audience
hazard the same word “metaphysician,” as
the answer, but are informed that they are wrong,—the
word now represented having only three syllables,
and they ultimately discover that the word is
“metaphor” (met afore).</p>

<p>In another charade of similar character, if the
audience be classically inclined, when the curtain
rises, nothing is seen but a little toy wooden horse,
such as can be bought for fifty cents. The spectators
are told that this forms a word of two syllables,
representing an island in the Ægean Sea. If the
spectators are well up in ancient geography, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
may possibly guess that Delos (deal ’oss) is referred
to. The curtain falls, and again rises on the same
contemptible object, which is now stated to represent
a second island in the same part of the world.
The classical reader will at once see that Samos
(same ’oss) is intended. Again the curtain rises
on the representation of another island. <i>Two</i>
little wooden horses now occupy the scene, Paros
(pair ’oss) being the island referred to. Once
more the curtain rises, this time on a group of
charming damsels, each reclining in a woe-begone
attitude, surrounded by pill-boxes and physic-bottles,
and apparently suffering from some painful
malady. This scene represents a word of three
syllables, and is stated to include all that has gone
before. Cyclades (sick ladies), the name of the
group to which Delos, Samos, and Paros belong,
is of course the answer.</p>

<p>Another comical charade is a performance representing
the word “imitation.” The spectators
are informed that the charade about to be performed
can only be exhibited to one person at a
time. One person is accordingly admitted into the
room in which the actors are congregated. The
unhappy wight stares about him with curiosity, not
unmingled with apprehension, fearing to be made
the victim of some practical joke; nor is his comfort
increased by finding that his every look or
action is faithfully copied by each person present.
This continues until he has either guessed or given
up the word, when a fresh victim is admitted, and
the new initiate becomes in turn one of the actors.
Sometimes, however, the victim manages to turn the
laugh against his persecutors. We have known a
young lady, seeing through the joke, quietly take
a chair, and remain motionless, reducing the matter
to a simple trial of patience between herself
and the company.</p>

<p>Acted charades, to be successful, demand much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
care and preparation. There are numerous printed
collections of charades of this kind, obtainable
from any bookseller. Whatever be the charade
selected, we cannot too strongly impress upon
the reader the advantage of frequent and careful
rehearsal.</p>

<h2>JUVENILE GAMES.</h2>


<h3>“<span class="smcap">What d’ye Buy?</span>”</h3>

<p>This game may be played by any number from
three to thirteen. There are a dozen good-sized
pieces of cardboard, each bearing a colored illustration
of one of the “trades” following: viz., a milliner,
a fishmonger, a greengrocer, plumber, a
music-seller, a toyman, mason, a pastrycook, a
hardware-man, a tailor, a poulterer, and a doctor.
Besides these there are a number of smaller tickets,
half a dozen to each trade. Each of these has the
name of the particular trade and also the name of
some article in which the particular tradesman in
question may be considered to deal. A book
accompanies the cards, containing a nonsense
story, with a blank at the end of each sentence.</p>

<p>One of the players is chosen as leader, and the
others each select a trade, receiving the appropriate
picture, and the six cards containing the names
of the articles in which the tradesman deals. He
places his “sign” before him on the table, and
holds the remainder of his cards in his hand. The
leader then reads the story, and whenever he comes
to one of the blanks, he glances towards one of the
other players, who must immediately, under penalty
of a forfeit, supply the blank with some article
he sells, at the same time laying down the card
bearing its name. The incongruity of the article
named with the context make the fun of the game,
which is heightened by the vigilance which each
player must exercise in order to avoid a forfeit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
Where the number of players is very small, each
may undertake two or more trades.</p>

<p>We will quote a small portion of the story, by
way of illustration. The concluding words indicate
the trade of the person at whom the leader glances
to fill up a given hiatus.</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen, I propose to relate some
curious adventures which befell me and my wife
Peggy the other day, but as I am troubled with a
complaint called ‘Non mi ricordo,’ or the ‘Can’t
remembers,’ I shall want each of you to tell me
what you sell: therefore when I stop and look at
one of you, you must be brisk in recommending
your goods. Whoever does not name something
before I count ‘three’ must pay a forfeit. Attention!</p>

<p>“Last Friday week I was awoke very early in the
morning by a loud knocking at my door in
Humguffin Court. I got up in a great fright, and
put on”—(looks at Toyman, who replies, “a fool’s
cap and bells,” and lays down that card).</p>

<p>“When I got downstairs, who should there be
but a fat porter, with a knot, on which he carried”—(Poulterer)
“a pound of pork sausages.”</p>

<p>“‘Hallo!’ said I, ‘my fine fellow, what do you
want at this time of day?’ He answered”—(Fishmonger)
“A cod’s head and shoulders.”</p>

<p>“‘Get along with you,’ I said; ‘there’s my
neighbor, Dr. Drenchall, I see, wants’”—(Butcher)
“a sheep’s head.”</p>

<p>“I now went up to shave, but my soap-dish was
gone, and the maid brought me instead”—(Milliner)
“a lady’s chip hat.”</p>

<p>“My razor had been taken to chop firewood, so
I used”—(Greengrocer) “a cucumber.”</p>

<p>“I then washed my face in”—(Doctor) “a cup
of quinine,” “cleaned my teeth with”—(Fishmonger)
“a fresh herring,” and “combed my
hair with”—(Pastrycook) “a jam tart.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>“My best coat was taken possession of by pussy
and kittens, so I whipped on”—(hardware-man)
“a dripping pan.”</p>

<p>“The monkey, seeing how funny I looked,
snatched off my wig, and clapped on my head”—(Poulterer)
“a fat hen.”</p>

<p>“I now awoke my wife, and asked her what she
had nice for breakfast; she said”—(Doctor) “a
mustard plaster.”</p>

<p>“Then I scolded Sukey, the servant, and called
her” (Poulterer) “a tough old turkey.”</p>

<p>“But she saucily told me I was no better than”—(Music-seller)
“an old fiddle.”</p>

<p>“I soon had enough of that, so I asked my wife
to go with me to buy”—(Tailor) “a pair of trousers.”</p>

<p>“But she said she must have her lunch first,
which consisted of——” etc., etc., through half
a dozen pages, the tradesmen supplying more or
less appropriate articles to fill up the gaps in the
discourse.</p>


<h3>“<span class="smcap">A Trip To Paris.</span>”</h3>

<p>There is another game on the same principle,
known by the somewhat ambitious title of “The
most Laughable Thing on Earth; or A Trip to
Paris.” The tickets for this game are nearly 150 in
number, each containing name and grotesque sketch
of some article or articles, as “a hod of mortar,” “a
guinea-pig,” “a basin of gruel,” “a wheelbarrow,”
“a jar of pickles,” “a tub of soft soap,”
“two dozen eggs,” “Jemima’s new bonnet,”
“some castor-oil,” “a penny whistle,” “a peck of
peas,” etc., etc. The game is full of innocent
nonsense and played precisely as in the last case
(save that there is no reference to any particular
trades). The story to be read by the leader commences
as follows:</p>

<p>“Brown, Jones, and Robinson were walking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
together in the streets of Boston, when Brown suddenly
exclaimed, ‘I will go to Paris, and return
the personification of ——’</p>

<p>“‘I, too,’ said Jones, ‘should like to see Paris,
but I have not got ——’</p>

<p>“‘And I should like to accompany you,’ said Robinson,
‘if I knew ——’</p>

<p>“‘Go with us then,” said Brown, ‘and we’ll
have ——’</p>

<p>“‘There’s an excursion train to New York in
the morning; we can see the “lions” there on
our way, and then take ——’</p>

<p>“It was now ‘Pack and off!’ Brown went to
bid his friends good-bye, giving to each a parting
gift. To an old schoolfellow he gave ——</p>

<p>“To Matilda Jane, a young lady who laid claim
to his heart, he gave, with a kiss, ——</p>

<p>“Now, Matilda Jane would not be outdone, so
she kissed him twice, and begged him to accept
of ——</p>

<p>“Brown was perplexed, but he took the gift,
and going home was saluted by the children, who
shouted, ‘There goes a man with ——’</p>

<p>“That night he had wonderful dreams; he
thought he was chased by ——</p>

<p>“And that he was trying to crowd into his carpetbag ——</p>

<p>“When a man came along and charged him with
stealing ——</p>

<p>“He was enraged at this, and was about to pitch
into the man, when he awoke, and found it all a
dream, caused by his having eaten for supper ——</p>

<p>“He was early at the station, and on asking for
a ticket, the clerk gave him ——”</p>

<p>And so on, in like manner. These last games,
as a change from graver recreations, make a good
deal of fun, particularly with young players.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Cook who Doesn’t Like Peas.</span></h3>

<p>The fun of this game depends on a fair proportion
of the players not being acquainted with it.
The leader begins, addressing the first player, “I
have a cook who doesn’t like peas (<i>p’s</i>); what will
you give her for her dinner?” The person addressed,
if acquainted with the secret, avoids the letter <i>p</i> in
his answer, and, for example, says, “I will give
her some walnuts.” The question is then asked of
the second person, who, if unacquainted with the
trick, is likely enough to offer some delicacy which
contains the letter <i>p</i>; <i>e. g.</i>, potatoes, asparagus,
pork, apple-pie, pickled cabbage, peanuts, etc., etc.
When this occurs, the offender is called upon to
pay a forfeit, but the precise nature of his offence
is not explained to him. He is simply told, in answer
to his expostulations, that “the cook doesn’t
like <i>p’s</i>.” When a sufficient number of forfeits has
been extracted, the secret is revealed, and those
who have not already guessed it are aggravated by
being told over and over again that the cook did
not like <i>p’s</i>, and if they would persist in giving
them to her, they must, of course, take the consequences.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Word-making.</span></h3>

<p>It is surprising what a fund of amusement may
be derived by the children from four or five alphabets,
printed on card-board, and then cut up into,
say, half-inch squares, with a single letter on each.
A double supply of vowels will be found an advantage.
The most simple mode of using the alphabets
is for one person to pick out the letters forming
some word, <i>e. g.</i>, “nevertheless,” and then hand
them, well mixed together, to another player, who
endeavors to discover what word they form.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>Another game is played as follows.—The players,
each of whom is supplied with paper and pencil,
are divided equally into two sides, and the
leader having selected a word, suppose “notwithstanding,”
each party sets to work to see how many
different words they can make of the same letters.
(Thus from the word above suggested may be made
“not, with, stand, standing, gin, ton, to, wig, wit,
his, twit, tan, has, had, an, nod, tow, this, sat, that,
sit, sin, tin, wing, what, who, wish, win, wan, won,”
and probably a host of others.) A scrutiny is then
taken, all words common to both parties being
struck out. The remainder are then compared, and
the victory is adjudged to the one having the
largest number of words.</p>

<p>Sometimes the division into sides is dispensed
with, and each player depends on himself. Another
purpose for which the alphabets in question is used
is that of forming <i>anagrams</i>, in the composition of
which they are a very great assistance, but this
is hardly simple enough for children. We are
inclined to doubt whether the results obtained in
this game bear a fair proportion to the labor involved;
though it is unquestionable that once in a
way an anagram is produced that is curiously
appropriate. We may instance the following:</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="anagrams">
<tr>
<td align="left">Telegraph,</td>
<td align="left">Great help,</td></tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Florence Nightingale,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align="left">Flit on, cheering angel,</td></tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Astronomers,</td><td align="left">Moon starers.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>A fourth Spelling Game is played by each person
drawing, say twenty letters hap-hazard, and trying
to form them into a sentence, the palm of merit
being awarded to the player who at the same time
produces the most coherent phrase, and also succeeds
in using the greatest proportion of the letters
assigned to him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The “Young Folks’ Concert.”</span></h3>

<p>The little players sit or stand round the room in
a circle. The leader assigns to each some musical
instrument, as harp, flute, violoncello, trombone,
etc., and also selects one for himself. Some well-known
tune is then given out, say “Yankee
Doodle,” and the players all begin to play accordingly,
each doing his best to imitate, both in sound
and action, the instrument which has been assigned
to him, the effect being generally extremely harmonious.
The leader commences with his own
instrument, but without any warning suddenly
ceases, and begins instead to perform on the
instrument assigned to one or other of the players.
Such player is bound to notice the change, and
forthwith to take to the instrument just abandoned
by the leader, incurring a forfeit if he fails to do so.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mary’s Little Lamb.</span></h3>

<p>This is a great favorite with the young folks.
When everything else has become tiresome, some
one starts the first line of the verse,</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Mary had a little lamb,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fleece as white as snow, etc.</span></div>
</div></div>

<p>All sing, and on the second verse being reached
the last syllable <i>of the first line</i> is dropped, then
the next to the last, the third, the fourth and so on,
until the line is totally omitted. The aim of the
singers is to keep exact time, counting a beat for
each omitted syllable, and any one whose voice
breaks in when all should be silent, pays a forfeit.
The same can be done with “John Brown’s Body,”
repeating the first verse and omitting syllable after
syllable at the end of the first line until there is
nothing left to sing but the chorus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Funny Outlines.</span></h3>

<p>The artistic faculty of the young folks is in this
case brought into requisition. Slips of paper being
distributed, each young player marks on his slip
a crooked line of any shape he or she pleases. The
papers are then exchanged, and each has to draw
some sort of figure, working in as part of the outline
the crooked line already drawn by his
neighbor.</p>

<p>The best plan in this game is to allow the line
already drawn, if possible, to suggest some figure,
and to work out that idea. It is of course understood
that the works of art to be produced are only
expected to be of the very roughest description.
If there is a difficulty in dealing with the outline
as it stands, the player is entitled to place it on its
side, or even upside down, if he prefers it.</p>

<p>Thus a curve may suggest a swan, a square may
give a hint of a house, a wave-line of a snake or an
eel, a long sweeping curve may fit in as a horse’s
back, or an irregular outline may afford an idea for
a comical face. The sketches produced with strict
regard to the conditions of the game will be found
full of fun and novelty, if not characterized by any
high degree of art.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
